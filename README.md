responsive UI design. You will be introduced to various aspects of React
components. You will learn about React router and its use in developing
single-page applications. You will also learn about designing controlled
forms. You will be introduced to the Flux architecture and Redux. You
will explore various aspects of Redux and use it to develop React-Redux
powered applications. You will then learn to use Fetch for client-server
communication and the use of REST API on the server side. A quick tour
through React animation support and testing rounds off the course. You
must have preferably completed the previous course in the specialization
on Bootstrap 4, or have a working knowledge of Bootstrap 4 to be able to
navigate this course. Also, a good working knowledge of JavaScript,
especially ES 5 is strongly recommended.

    using Visual Studio Code (<https://code.visualstudio.com/>) as the
    editor of choice in this specialization. You may also consider other
    editors such as Brackets (<http://brackets.io/>), Sublime Text
    (<http://www.sublimetext.com/)>, or Atom (<https://atom.io/>).

2.  <b>Browser of your choice</b>: You may use your preferred browser. I
    will be using Chrome as the browser in all the exercises. All the
    exercises and assignments in this course have been tested using
    Chrome v. 46. Please note that not all browsers may support all the
    HTML5 features to the same extent. You might encounter problems when
    using other browsers. I strongly urge you to use the latest Chrome
    browser for the exercises and assignments in this course so that any
    problems are minimized.

3.  <b>Command line shell</b>: Familiarity with the command-line shell will
    be essential for the exercises. In Windows a cmd window or power
    shell with admin privileges would be needed. On a Mac or in Linux, a
    terminal window can be used. Please get familiar with the \"sudo\"
    command in OS X and Linux.

4.  <b>Files required for the exercises</b>: We will provide additional
    starter files for the exercises wherever needed. Links to download
    the files will be provided inline in the <b>exercise instructions</b>
    that follow each exercise video. Please download the files provided
    there, if any, before beginning the exercise. The links are also
    available through the <b>Additional Resources</b> of the specific
    lesson.

Note: Please remember to retain the folders and all the files that you
create in the exercises. Further exercises will build upon the files
that you create in the preceding exercises. DO NOT DELETE the files at
the end of the exercises, unless otherwise instructed. You may wish to
set up your exercise folder as a Git repository and commit the files to
the repository at the end of each exercise.

## Basic Git Commands

-   At a convenient location on your computer, create a folder named
    <b>git-test</b>.

-   Open this git-test folder in your favorite editor.

-   Add a file named <i>index.html</i> to this folder, and add the following
    HTML code to this file:

> \<!DOCTYPE html\>
> \<html\>
>     \<head\>\</head\>
>     \<body\>
>         \<h1\>This is a Header\</h1\>
>     \</body\>
> \</html\>

Initializing the folder as a Git repository

-   Go to the git-test folder in your cmd window/terminal and type the
    following at the prompt to initialize the folder as a Git
    repository:

> git init

### Checking your Git repository status

-   Type the following at the prompt to check your Git repository\'s
    status:

> git status

Adding files to the staging area

-   To add files to the staging area of your Git repository, type:

> git add .

Commiting to the Git repository

-   To commit the current staging area to your Git repository, type:

> git commit -m \"first commit\"

Checking the log of Git commits

-   To check the log of the commits to your Git repository, type

> git log --oneline

-   Now, modify the <i>index.html</i> file as follows:

> \<!DOCTYPE html\>
> \<html\>
>     \<head\>\</head\>
>     \<body\>
>         \<h1\>This is a Header\</h1\>
>         \<p\>This is a paragraph\</p\>
>     \</body\>
> \</html\>

-   Add a sub-folder named <b>templates</b> to your <b>git-test</b> folder,
    and then add a file named <i>test.html</i> to the templates folder. Then
    set the contents of this file to be the same as the <i>index.html</i>
    file above.

-   Then check the status and add all the files to the staging area.

-   Then do the second commit to your repository

-   Now, modify the <i>index.html</i> file as follows:

> \<!DOCTYPE html\>
> \<html\>
>     \<head\>\</head\>
>     \<body\>
>         \<h1\>This is a Header\</h1\>
>         \<p\>This is a paragraph\</p\>
>         \<p\>This is a second paragraph\</p\>
>     \</body\>
> \</html\>

-   Now add the modified index.html file to the staging area and then do
    a third commit.

### Checking out a file from an earlier commit

-   To check out the index.html from the second commit, find the number
    of the second commit using the git log, and then type the following
    at the prompt:

> git checkout \<second commit\'s number\> index.html

### Resetting the Git repository

-   To discard the effect of the previous operation and restore
    index.html to its state at the end of the third commit, type:

> git reset HEAD index.html

-   Then type the following at the prompt:

> git checkout \-- index.html

-   You can also use <i>git reset</i> to reset the staging area to the last
    commit without disturbing the working directory.

-   Complete the set up of Node.js and NPM on your machine

-   Verify that the installation was successful and your machine is
    ready for using Node.js and NPM.

### Installing Node

-   To install Node on your machine, go to
    [https://nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) and click on the Download
    button. Depending on your computer\'s platform (Windows, MacOS or
    Linux), the appropriate installation package is downloaded.

-   As an example, on a Mac, you will see the following web page. Click
    on the Download button. Follow along the instructions to install
    Node on your machine. (Note: Now Node gives you the option of
    installing a mature and dependable LTS version and a more newer
    stable version. You should to install the LTS version. I will use
    this version in the course.)

<b>Note: On Windows machines, you may need to configure your PATH
environmental variable in case you forgot to turn on the add to PATH
during the installation steps.</b>

### Verifying the Node Installation

-   Open a terminal window on your machine. If you are using a Windows
    machine, open a cmd window or PowerShell window with <b>admin</b>
    privileges.

-   To ensure that your NodeJS setup is working correctly, type the
    following at the command prompt to check for the version of <b>Node</b>
    and <b>NPM</b>

## Exercise (Video): Basics of Node.js and NPM

## Exercise (Instructions): Basics of Node.js and NPM

### Objectives and Outcomes

In this exercise you will learn the basics of Node and NPM. At the end
of this exercise, you will be able to:

-   Set up package.json file in the project folder for configuring your
    Node and NPM for this project

-   Install a NPM module and make use of it within your project

### Initializing package.json

-   At the command prompt in your <b>git-test</b> folder, type

> npm init

-   Follow along the prompts and answer the questions as follows: accept
    the default values for most of the entries, except set the entry
    point to index.html

-   This should create a <i>package.json</i> file in your <b>git-test</b>
    folder.

### Installing an NPM Module

-   Install an NPM module, lite-server, that allows you to run a Node.js
    based development web server and serve up your project files. To do
    this, type the following at the prompt:

> npm install lite-server \--save-dev

-   You can check out more documentation on lite-server
    [here](https://github.com/johnpapa/lite-server).

-   Next, open package.json in your editor and modify it as shown below.
    Note the addition of two lines, line 7 and line 9.

> {
>   \"name\": \"git-test\",
>   \"version\": \"1.0.0\",
>   \"description\": \"This is the Git and Node basic learning project\",
>   \"main\": \"index.html\",
>   \"scripts\": {
>     \"start\": \"npm run lite\",
>     \"test\": \"echo \\\"Error: no test specified\\\" && exit 1\",
>     \"lite\": \"lite-server\"
>   },
>   \"repository\": {
>     \"type\": \"git\",
>     \"url\": \"git+[https://jogesh_k\_muppala@bitbucket.org/jogesh_k\_muppala/git-test.git]{.underline}\"
>   },
>   \"author\": \"\",
>   \"license\": \"ISC\",
>   \"homepage\": \"[https://bitbucket.org/jogesh_k\_muppala/git-test#readme]{.underline}\",
>   \"devDependencies\": {
>     \"lite-server\": \"\^2.2.2\"
>   }
> }

-   Next, start the development server by typing the following at the
    prompt:

> npm start

-   This should open your <i>index.html</i> page in your default browser.

-   If you now open the <i>index.html</i> page in an editor and make changes
    and save, the browser should immediately refresh to reflect the
    changes.

### Setting up .gitignore

-   Next, create a file in your project directory named <i>.gitignore</i>
    (<b>Note</b>: the name starts with a period)Then, add the following to
    the .gitignore file

> node_modules

-   Then do a git commit and push the changes to the online repository.
    You will note that the node_modules folder will not be added to the
    commit, and will not be uploaded to the repository.

### Conclusions

In this exercise you learnt to set up package.json, install a npm
package and start a development server.

## Module 4: Introduction to React: Objectives and Outcomes

In this lesson you will be given a quick overview of JavaScript
frameworks and libraries and then introduced to React in particular. We
will learn some basics of React and how to configure a React application
using the create-react-app the command line tool. At the end of this
lesson, you will be able to:

-   Get a basic overview of JavaScript frameworks and libraries

-   Understand the architecture of an React application

-   Scaffold out a starter React application using <i>create-react-app</i>,
    the command line tool

## Front-end JavaScript Frameworks and Libraries Overview

## Introduction to React

## Exercise (Video): Getting Started with React

## Exercise (Instructions): Getting Started with React

### Objectives and Outcomes

In this first React exercise, you will first install <i>create-react-app</i>,
the command line tool for scaffolding React applications. You will then
use the tool to scaffold out a basic React application. We will
thereafter develop this application into a full-fledged React
application in the process of doing the exercises in this course. At the
end of this exercise you will be able to:

-   Install <i>create-react-app</i>

-   Scaffold out a basic React application

### Installing Yarn

-   Yarn is another package manager like NPM, but is better suited and
    faster to work with for React applications. So let us install yarn
    and use it for building our React applications.

-   To install Yarn, you can find the instructions for your specific
    platform at <https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install>.

-   If you choose not to install Yarn, you can continue to use npm in
    place of yarn without any problem.

### Installing create-react-app

From the React documentation we learn that the <i>create-react-app</i> CLI
makes it easy to create an application that already works, right out of
the box. It already follows the best practices suggested by the React
community!

-   To install <i>create-react-app</i> globally, type the following at the
    prompt:

> yarn global add <create-react-app@1.5.2>

Use <i>sudo</i> on a Mac and Linux. Alternately you can use npm, by typing
\"npm install -g create-react-app@1.5.2\".

-   This will make the command line tool for creating React
    applications. To learn more about the various commands that this CLI
    provides, type at the prompt:

```
> create-react-app --help
```

### Generating and Serving a React Project using create-react-app

-   At a convenient location on your computer, create a folder named
    <i>React</i> and move into that folder.

-   Then type the following at the prompt to create a new React
    application named <i>confusion</i>:

> create-react-app confusion

-   This should create a new folder named <i>confusion</i> within your
    <i>React</i> folder and create the React application in that folder.

-   Move to the <i>confusion</i> folder and type the following at the prompt:

> yarn start

-   This will compile the project and then open a tab in your default
    browser at the address \<Your Computer\'s Name\>:3000.

-   You can initialize your project to be a Git repository by typing the
    following commands at the prompt:

> git init
> git add .
> git commit -m \"Initial Setup\"

-   Thereafter you can set up an online Git repository and synchronize
    your project to the online repository. Make sure that the online Git
    repository is a <b><i>private</i></b> repository.

### Conclusions

In this exercise you installed the create-react-app CLI tool and created
a basic React project and served up the compiled project to your
browser.

### Objectives and Outcomes

In this exercise you will get familiar with some basic Git commands. At
the end of this exercise you will be able to:

-   Set up a folder as a Git repository

-   Perform basic Git operations on your Git repository

### Basic Git Commands

-   At a convenient location on your computer, create a folder named
    <b>git-test</b>.

-   Open this git-test folder in your favorite editor.

-   Add a file named <i>index.html</i> to this folder, and add the following
    HTML code to this file:

> \<!DOCTYPE html\>
> \<html\>
>     \<head\>\</head\>
>
>     \<body\>
>         \<h1\>This is a Header\</h1\>
>     \</body\>
> \</html\>

### Initializing the folder as a Git repository

-   Go to the git-test folder in your cmd window/terminal and type the
    following at the prompt to initialize the folder as a Git
    repository:

> git init

### Checking your Git repository status

-   Type the following at the prompt to check your Git repository\'s
    status:

> git status

### Adding files to the staging area

-   To add files to the staging area of your Git repository, type:

> git add .

### Commiting to the Git repository

-   To commit the current staging area to your Git repository, type:

> git commit -m \"first commit\"

### Checking the log of Git commits

-   To check the log of the commits to your Git repository, type

> git log \--oneline

-   Now, modify the <i>index.html</i> file as follows:

> \<!DOCTYPE html\>
> \<html\>
>     \<head\>\</head\>
>     \<body\>
>         \<h1\>This is a Header\</h1\>
>         \<p\>This is a paragraph\</p\>
>     \</body\>
> \</html\>

-   Add a sub-folder named <b>templates</b> to your <b>git-test</b> folder,
    and then add a file named <i>test.html</i> to the templates folder. Then
    set the contents of this file to be the same as the <i>index.html</i>
    file above.

-   Then check the status and add all the files to the staging area.

-   Then do the second commit to your repository

-   Now, modify the <i>index.html</i> file as follows:

> \<!DOCTYPE html\>
> \<html\>
>     \<head\>\</head\>

an online repository.

## Node.js and NPM

JavaScript which was designed as a scripting language for the
browser, has seen deployment far beyond the browser. 

Node.js has played a significant role in this shift of JavaScript from
the browser to the desktop. 

Let\'s now learn a little bit about what node.js is and what role does
NPM,  the Node Package Manager, play in the context of node.js. 

Node.js as I mentioned earlier, allows us to bring the power of
JavaScript to the desktop. 

Node.js is based on  the JavaScript runtime engine that has been built
for the Chrome browser. 

The Chrome V8 JavaScript engine has been ported from the browser to run
on the desktop and support the execution of JavaScript programs on the
desktop. 

Node.js is built around an event driven non blocking I/O model which
makes it very efficient to run JavaScript programs on the desktop and
synchronous Javascript on the desktop. 

Now, this is where node finds its true pouch. 

Right now, we will examine Node.js In the context of its use as a
JavaScript runtime. 

We\'ll look at the server-side application of Node.js In detail in the
last course of this specialization. 

This is the typical architecture of Node.js. 

In this, the Chrome V8 engine is at the bottom layer together with libuv
forms, the layer that interacts with the underlying computer system to
support the execution of JavaScript programs. 

On top of it, we have Node Bindings which are also implemented in C++. 

At the top layer, you have the Node.js and standard library which are
all implemented in JavaScript, and this is what enables us to write
JavaScript programs and run them on the desktop. 

Naturally, the ability to run JavaScript programs on the desktop
energize the web development community to explore using JavaScript to
develop a significant number of web development tools. 

Tools such as Bower, Grunt, Gulp, Yeoman, and many others. 

We will explore some of these in the later part of this course and in
subsequent courses. 

The last course in the specialization, as I mentioned, looks at the use
of Node.js on the server side. 

How we can develop Web server, Business logic, all implemented in
JavaScript on the server site. 

Together with Node, you often hear people talking about the Node Package
Manager or NPM. 

When you install Node on your computer, NPM automatically gets
installed. 

The Node Package Manager is the manager for the node ecosystem
that manages all the node modules and packages that have been made
publicly available by many different users. 

A typical node package consist of JavaScript files together with a
file called package.json which is the manifest file for this node
module. 

We will look at how we can use the package.json file in more detail in
the subsequent exercises.

## Exercise (Video): Setting up Node.js and NPM

## Exercise (Instructions): Setting up Node.js and NPM

<b>Note: Make sure you have installed Git on your machine before you
install Node.js. Please complete the previous Git installation exercise
before proceeding with this exercise.</b>

### Objectives and Outcomes

In this exercise, you will learn to set up the Node.js environment, a
popular Javascript based server framework, and node package manager
(NPM) on your machine. To learn more about NodeJS, you can visit
[https://nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/). For this course, you just
need to install Node.js on your machine and make use of it for running
some front-end tools. You will learn more about the server-side support
using Node.js in a subsequent course. At the end of this exercise, you
will be able to:

-   Complete the set up of Node.js and NPM on your machine

-   Verify that the installation was successful and your machine is
    ready for using Node.js and NPM.

### Installing Node

-   To install Node on your machine, go to
    [https://nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) and click on the Download
    button. Depending on your computer\'s platform (Windows, MacOS or
    Linux), the appropriate installation package is downloaded.

-   As an example, on a Mac, you will see the following web page. Click
    on the Download button. Follow along the instructions to install
    Node on your machine. (Note: Now Node gives you the option of
    installing a mature and dependable LTS version and a more newer
    stable version. You should to install the LTS version. I will use
    this version in the course.)

<b>Note: On Windows machines, you may need to configure your PATH
environmental variable in case you forgot to turn on the add to PATH
during the installation steps.</b>

### Verifying the Node Installation

-   Open a terminal window on your machine. If you are using a Windows
    machine, open a cmd window or PowerShell window with <b>admin</b>
    privileges.

-   To ensure that your NodeJS setup is working correctly, type the
    following at the command prompt to check for the version of <b>Node</b>
    and <b>NPM</b>

![](./images/image002.png){width="6.5in" height="8.2875in"}

> npm -v

### Conclusions

At the end of this exercise, your machine is now ready with the Node
installed for further development. We will examine web development tools
next.

### Exercise (Instructions): Basics of Node.js and NPM

### Objectives and Outcomes

In this exercise you will learn the basics of Node and NPM. At the end
of this exercise, you will be able to:

-   Set up package.json file in the project folder for configuring your
    Node and NPM for this project

-   Install a NPM module and make use of it within your project

### Initializing package.json

-   At the command prompt in your <b>git-test</b> folder, type

> npm init

-   Follow along the prompts and answer the questions as follows: accept
    the default values for most of the entries, except set the entry
    point to index.html

-   This should create a <i>package.json</i> file in your <b>git-test</b>
    folder.

Installing an NPM Module

-   Install an NPM module, lite-server, that allows you to run a Node.js
    based development web server and serve up your project files. To do
    this, type the following at the prompt:

> npm install lite-server \--save-dev

-   You can check out more documentation on lite-server
    [here](https://github.com/johnpapa/lite-server).

-   Next, open package.json in your editor and modify it as shown below.
    Note the addition of two lines, line 7 and line 9.

>    \"start\": \"npm run lite\",
>    \"test\": \"echo \\\"Error: no test specified\\\" && exit 1\",
>    \"lite\": \"lite-server\"
>  },
>  \"repository\": {
>    \"type\": \"git\",
>    \"url\": \"git+[https://jogesh_k\_muppala@bitbucket.org/jogesh_k\_muppala/git-test.git]{.underline}\"
>  },
>  \"author\": \"\",
>  \"license\": \"ISC\",

>  \"devDependencies\": {
>    \"lite-server\": \"\^2.2.2\"
>  }
>}

-   Next, start the development server by typing the following at the
    prompt:

> npm start

-   This should open your <i>index.html</i> page in your default browser.

-   If you now open the <i>index.html</i> page in an editor and make changes
    and save, the browser should immediately refresh to reflect the
    changes.

### Setting up .gitignore

-   Next, create a file in your project directory named <i>.gitignore</i>
    (<b>Note</b>: the name starts with a period)Then, add the following to
    the .gitignore file

```
node_modules
```

-   Then do a git commit and push the changes to the online repository.
    You will note that the node_modules folder will not be added to the
    commit, and will not be uploaded to the repository.

### Conclusions

In this exercise you learnt to set up package.json, install a npm
package and start a development server.

## Introduction to React: Objectives and Outcomes

In this lesson you will be given a quick overview of JavaScript
frameworks and libraries and then introduced to React in particular. We
will learn some basics of React and how to configure a React application
using the create-react-app the command line tool. At the end of this
lesson, you will be able to:

-   Get a basic overview of JavaScript frameworks and libraries

-   Understand the architecture of an React application

-   Scaffold out a starter React application using <i>create-react-app</i>,
    the command line tool

### Front-end JavaScript Frameworks and Libraries Overview

## Introduction to React

We ended the previous lecture with a question, is React a library or is
it a framework and what exactly is React? 

Let\'s examine these questions in a bit more detail in this lecture. 

Let\'s start out with the very first question. 

What exactly is React and how is it different from the other frameworks
or libraries that we have mentioned in the previous lecture? 

When you visit React website, you see it clearly specified right on the
front page that React is a JavaScript library for building user
interfaces. 

Now again, depending on who you ask some people tend to  call React a
library and others tend to call it a framework. 

Now, let\'s not bother ourselves too much in splitting our hairs over
whether it is a framework, or a library but let\'s concentrate more on
what it actually helps us accomplish. 

It is more important for us to understand that rather than worrying
about whether it is a framework or a library. 

The React approach to implementing them applications is what we are
after in this course. 

So, React also states that it uses a declarative approach. 

Now that leaves you in a confused state because we saw that frameworks
generally tend to use the declarative approach. 

But in React, the declarative approach used by React as specified on its
website says that, it makes it easy to create interactive UIs with
simple views for each state within your application. 

And also React takes care of automatically updating the UI and then
rendering any changes to their specific components as required on your
page. 

You just heard me mentioning the term Component. 

React Indeed is a component based approach. 

In a Component based approach, we encapsulate behaviors into small units
called Components. 

We will examine Components in more detail in the next lesson. 

There it will become more clear to you how, and why a component based
approach is useful for implementing our Web applications in React. 

Furthermore, React makes no assumptions about the entire technology
stack that you\'re going to use for implementing your Web applications. 

React plays well with any technology stack that you can use behind the
seats. 

React itself concentrates only on the user interface side of the
story, and that leaves it up to the application designer to decide how
they want to implement the architecture and how they want your
application to interact with the back-end server. 

So, as we go through this course, we will examine one approach that we
use for implementing the entire technology stack which includes the Flux
architecture approach, and in specifically the use of Redux for
implementing a state based storage for our Web application and also the
use of Fetch for interacting with our back-end server. 

Again, I\'ve mentioned a few terms like Flux, Redux, and Fetch. 

We will examine these towards the second half of this course. 

It\'s obviously useful to examine the history behind the React
approach. 

So, to understand where React originated, and how it came about to the
state it is today. 

React was first designed by Jordan Walke who was part of the Facebook
team. 

It was first deployed for Facebook\'s news feed around 2011. 

Subsequently in 2013, React was open sourced at this JS conference. 

React took off as an approach for implementing Web applications from
then onwards. 

React is designed for speed, speed of implementing the application,
simplicity, and scalability. 

The three essence of React, and why it has become so popular in the real
value. 

As we examine React more in this course, you\'ll become more and more
familiar with why this approach is very suited for implementing Web
applications. 

As you enter the React world you will be bombarded with a lot of
vocabulary that is used in the React world. 

You will hear people talking about One-way data flow especially in the
context of the Flux Architecture. 

You will often hear people mentioning about JSX, we will examine JSX in
the very next lecture and understand what role it plays in developing a
React application. 

We\'ll hear about Components which we will examine in the next lesson
and also in the second module of this course in more detail and we\'ll
here about the state and how a React Component interacts with the state
of your application and the way you store the state of your
application, or do you store the state in a specific component. 

We\'ll also hear about Props, a way of passing data between the various
components. 

Also, we\'ll hear about Virtual Dom, and how is it different from Real
DOM. 

Why React manipulate the Virtual DOM, and how the Virtual DOM eventually
gets incorporated, or rendered onto the Real DOM. 

And Element, the React Element, which is the smallest unit of building
up a React application. 

A component being a collection of React elements. 

Then we hear about the Flux and Redux architectures in a bit more
detail. 

Again, as we go along this course we will examine these concepts and
these terminology in more detail. 

Again, don\'t get overwhelmed with the vocabulary that you hear in the
React world. 

If you learn step by step, you\'ll begin to pretty soon get a very good
handle on all this vocabulary and you can easily go ahead and impress
people by throwing these words at them, and trying to impress them or
how much you know about React. 

So, this is the jargon that you will end up learning also at the end of
this course. 

Enough of the jargon. 

Let\'s go ahead and get our hands dirty by starting to build a full
fledged React application, which will form part of all the exercises as
you go through the rest of this course. 

We will start with our first exercise where we\'ll install the
create-react-app, which we will use to scaffold out our very first React
application in the first exercise, and then we will start building upon
this application throughout the remaining exercises of this course.

## Exercise (Video): Getting Started with React

Now that we have examined React briefly in the previous two lectures,
I\'m sure you\'re curious about getting started with React, getting your
hands dirty with starting out on a React application.

So, in this exercise, we will look at how we will get started with
React. I\'m sure by now your computer is already configured with Note
and you have access to NPM, the package manager that comes with Note.

## Exercise (Instructions): Getting Started with React

### Objectives and Outcomes

In this first React exercise, you will first install <i>create-react-app</i>,
the command line tool for scaffolding React applications. You will then
use the tool to scaffold out a basic React application. We will
thereafter develop this application into a full-fledged React
application in the process of doing the exercises in this course. At the
end of this exercise you will be able to:

-   Install <i>create-react-app</i>

-   Scaffold out a basic React application

### Installing Yarn

-   Yarn is another package manager like NPM, but is better suited and
    faster to work with for React applications. So let us install yarn
    and use it for building our React applications.

-   To install Yarn, you can find the instructions for your specific
    platform at <https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install>.

-   If you choose not to install Yarn, you can continue to use npm in
    place of yarn without any problem.

### Installing <i>create-react-app</i>

From the React documentation we learn that the <i>create-react-app</i> CLI
makes it easy to create an application that already works, right out of
the box. It already follows the best practices suggested by the React
community!

-   To install <i>create-react-app</i> globally, type the following at the
    prompt:

```
yarn global add create-react-app@1.5.2
```

Use <i>sudo</i> on a Mac and Linux. Alternately you can use npm, by typing
\"npm install -g create-react-app@1.5.2\".

-   This will make the command line tool for creating React
    applications. To learn more about the various commands that this CLI
    provides, type at the prompt:

```
create-react-app \--help
```

### Generating and Serving a React Project using <i>create-react-app</i>

-   At a convenient location on your computer, create a folder named
    <i>React</i> and move into that folder.

-   Then type the following at the prompt to create a new React
    application named <i>confusion</i>:

```
create-react-app confusion
```

-   This should create a new folder named <i>confusion</i> within your
    <i>React</i> folder and create the React application in that folder.

-   Move to the <i>confusion</i> folder and type the following at the prompt:

```
yarn start
```

-   This will compile the project and then open a tab in your default
    browser at the address \<Your Computer\'s Name\>:3000.

-   You can initialize your project to be a Git repository by typing the
    following commands at the prompt:

```
git commit -m \"Initial Setup\"
git init
git add .
```

-   Thereafter you can set up an online Git repository and synchronize
    your project to the online repository. Make sure that the online Git
    repository is a <b><i>private</i></b> repository.

### Conclusions

In this exercise you installed the create-react-app CLI tool and created
a basic React project and served up the compiled project to your
browser.

## React App Overview

## Introduction to JSX

## Exercise (Video): Configuring your React Application

## Exercise (Instructions): Configuring your React Application

### Objectives and Outcomes

In this exercise we will set up our project to use Reactstrap (a package
supporting easy to use React based Bootstrap 4 components). We will then
introduce our first reactstrap component into our application. At the
end of this exercise you will be able to:

-   Configure your React project to use reactstrap.

-   Start using reactstrap components in your application.

### Configure your React Project to use Reactstrap

-   To configure your project to use reactstrap, type the following at
    the prompt to install reactstrap, and Bootstrap 4:

```
yarn add bootstrap@4.0.0
yarn add reactstrap@5.0.0
yarn add react-popper@0.9.2
```

<b>Note</b>: You can also install the same using npm using the \"npm
install \<package\> \--save\" option if you are using npm instead of
yarn.

### Configure to use Bootstrap 4

-   Next, open index.js file in the src folder and add the following
    line into the imports:

> . . .
> import \'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css\';
> . . .

### Adding a Navigation Bar:

-   Open App.js in the src folder and update it as follows:
 
> class App extends Component {
>   render() {
>     return (
>       \<div className=\"App\"\>
>         \<Navbar dark color=\"primary\"\>
>           \<div className=\"container\"\>
>             \<NavbarBrand href=\"/\"\>Ristorante Con Fusion\</NavbarBrand\>
>           \</div\>
>         \</Navbar\>
>       \</div\>
>     );
>   }
> }
> 
> . . .
> 
> import { Navbar, NavbarBrand } from \'reactstrap\';
> 
> . . .

-   Do a Git commit with the message \"Configuring React\"

### Conclusions

In this exercise we learnt to configure our React application to use
Reactstrap.

## React Components: Objectives and Outcomes

In this lesson you will learn about React components and how we
construct an React component and design its views. At the end of this
lesson you will be able to:

-   Create a React component

-   Construct the React component code and the view for your component
    using JSX and JavaScript

### Objectives and Outcomes

In this exercise you will add the first component to your React
application and update its view using JSX. At the end of this exercise
you will be able to:

-   Add components to your React application

-   Use JSX to define the views of your component.

### Adding a Menu Component

-   First, download the <i>images.zip</i> file provided above and then unzip
    the file. Create a folder named <i>assets</i> in the <i>public</i> folder.
    Move the resulting <i>images</i> folder containing some PNG files to the
    React project\'s <i>public/assets</i> folder. These image files will be
    useful for our exercises.

-   Next, add a new folder named <i>components</i> in the <i>src</i> folder, and
    create a new file named <i>MenuComponent.js</i> in this folder.

-   Add the following code to <i>MenuComponent.js</i>:

>         this.state = {
>             dishes: \[
>                 {
>                   id: 0,
>                   name:\'Uthappizza\',

>     constructor(props) {
>        super(props);
> import React, { Component } from \'react\';
> import { Media } from \'reactstrap\';

-   Next, open <i>App.js</i> file and update it as follows:

> . . .
> 
> import Menu from \'./components/MenuComponent\';
> 
> . . .
> 
>     \<Menu /\>
> 
> . . .

-   Open <i>App.css</i> file and delete all its contents.

-   Save all changes and do a Git commit with the message \"Components
    Part 1\".

### Conclusions

In this exercise we added a new component to our React application,
added data to its class, and then updated the app to show the
information in the web page.

## React Components: State and Props

## Exercise (Video): React Components Part 2

## Exercise (Instructions): React Components Part 2

### Objectives and Outcomes

In this exercise we will continue modifying the menu component from the
previous exercise. Instead of a list, we will use a Card component from
reactstrap to display the menu in a different way. Also we will use the
Card component to display the details of a selected dish. At the end of
this exercise you will be able to:

-   Make use of the Card component to display a list of items.

-   Use the Card component to display detailed information.

### Exercise Resources

<b>dishes</b>

JS File

### Updating the Menu Component

-   Open <i>MenuComponent.js</i> and update its contents as follows. Note
    that we have removed the dishes variable from the state of the
    component, and updated it to use the Card: 

```
>     constructor(props) {
>         super(props);
>
>         this.state = {
>             selectedDish: null
>         }
>     }
>
>     onDishSelect(dish) {
>         this.setState({ selectedDish: dish});
>     }
>
>     renderDish(dish) {
>         if (dish != null)
>             return(
>                 \<Card\>
>                     \<CardImg top src={dish.image} alt={dish.name} /\>
>                     \<CardBody\>
>                       \<CardTitle\>{dish.name}\</CardTitle\>
>                       \<CardText\>{dish.description}\</CardText\>
>                     \</CardBody\>
>                 \</Card\>
>             );
>         else
>             return(
>                 \<div\>\</div\>
>             );
>     }
>
>     render() {
>         const menu = this.props.dishes.map((dish) =\> {

> class Menu extends Component {
>
> import { Card, CardImg, CardImgOverlay, CardText, CardBody,
>     CardTitle } from \'reactstrap\';
>  . . .
```

-   Add a folder named <i>shared</i> under the <i>src</i> folder.

-   In the <i>shared</i> folder, create a new file named <i>dishes.js</i> and add
    the following content to it (<b>Note</b>: Alternately you can download
    the <i>dishes.js</i> file given above in the Exercise Resources and move
    it to the shared folder. Make sure the file is named <i>dishes.js</i>):

Conclusions

In this exercise we used a list of Cards to display the information in
the menu component. Also, we used a card to display the details of a
selected dish.

It looks like this is your first peer-graded assignment. [Learn
more](https://learner.coursera.help/hc/articles/208279926-Submit-peer-reviewed-assignments)

<b>Ready for the assignment?</b>

You will find instructions below to submit.

In this assignment you will add a new component to the React application
to show the details of a selected dish. You will use the Card component
and the Bootstrap unstyled list component to prepare the view for this
new component.

## Step-By-Step Assignment Instructions

<b>less </b>

<b>Objectives and Outcomes</b>

In this assignment, you will continue to work with the React application
that you have been developing in the exercises. You will add a new
component named <b><i>DishdetailComponent</i></b> that will display the details
of a selected dish. You will then design the view for the component
using the card component. At the end of this assignment, you should have
completed the following tasks:

-   Created a new DishdetailComponent and added it to your React
    > application.

-   Updated the view of the DishdetailComponent to display the details
    > of the selected dish using an reactstrap card component.

-   Updated the view of the DishdetailComponent to display the list of
    > comments about the dish using the Bootstrap unstyled list
    > component.

<b>Assignment Requirements</b>

This assignment requires you to complete the following tasks. Detailed
instructions for each task are given below. The picture of the completed
web page included below indicates the location within the web page that
will be updated by the three tasks.

<b>Task 1</b>

In this task you will be adding a new <b><i>DishdetailComponent</i></b> to your
React application and include the component into the menu component\'s
view so that the details of a specific dish are displayed there:

-   Replace the card showing the selected dish in MenuComponent\'s view
    > with the DishdetailComponent, and make sure to pass the selected
    > dish information as props to the DishdetailComponent.

-   Create a new <i>DishDetail</i> class in a file named
    > <i>DishdetailComponent.js</i> in the <i>components</i> folder

-   Export the <i>DishDetail</i> class from this file so that it can be
    > imported in <i>MenuComponent.js</i> and used to construct the view of
    > the selected dish.

-   Return a \<div\> from the render() function. This \<div\> should use
    > the Bootstrap <i>row</i> class to position the content within the
    > \<div\>. This div will display both the details of the dish in a
    > Card and the list of comments side-by-side for medium to extra
    > large screens, but will stack them for xs and sm screens.

-   The card should be enclosed inside a \<div\> appropriate Bootstrap
    > column classes so that it occupies the entire 12 columns for the
    > xs and sm screen sizes, and 5 columns for md screens and above.
    > Also apply a class of m-1 to this div.

-   The comments should be enclosed in a \<div\> to which you apply
    > appropriate column classes so that it occupies the entire 12
    > columns for the xs and sm screen sizes, and 5 columns for md
    > screens and above. Also apply a class of m-1 to this div.

-   If the dish is null then you should return an empty \<div\>

<b>Task 2</b>

In this task you will be adding a card component to the
<b><i>DishdetailComponent</i></b> view to display the details of the dish given
above:

-   Implement a function named renderDish() that takes the dish as a
    > parameter and returns the JSX code for laying out the details of
    > the dish in a reactstrap Card. You have already seen this as part
    > of the MenuComponent class in the exercise earlier.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Display the name of the dish as the Card title, and the description
    > as the Card text.

<b>Task 3</b>

In this task you will use the comments that are included in the dish
object above to display a list of the comments for the dish. Please use
your JavaScript knowledge to recall how you would access an inner
property in a JavaScript object that itself points to an array of
JavaScript objects (comments). This task involves the following steps:

-   Implement a function named renderComments() that takes the comments
    > array as a parameter and lays out each comment as shown in the
    > image below. You should use the Bootstrap list-unstyled class on
    > the list.

-   Each comment should be displayed on two lines, the first one showing
    > the comment, and the second line showing the comment author\'s
    > name and the date.

-   The comments should contain a \<h4\> header with the word
    > \"Comments\".

-   Remember to enclose the header and comments inside a \<div\> before
    > returning the JSX code. Otherwise React will not do the layout
    > correctly.

-   If the comments are null, then you should return an empty \<div\>.

## Module 5: Ideation: Objectives and Outcomes

The first step in your journey towards the implementation of the
Capstone project begins with an idea. In this module you will develop
the idea for your project, the set of expected features, survey the
market to look at similar ideas to enable you to differentiate your
project from others, while at the same time drawing inspiration from
them. You are required to submit a formal ideation report following the
structure given in the template. This will enable your peers to provide
you feedback and suggestions for your project.

Before you get started on a project, the first step is to develop the
idea for the project. In this module you will explore how you develop
your idea and come up with possible set of features for your project. At
the end of this step you should be able to:

-   Clearly express the central idea of your project, and identify the
    problem being addressed

-   Delineate a set of features that you expect your website and app
    should support

-   Identify other projects that might have similar features and would
    act as exemplars for your project

## Ideation Report Template

### Project Title

## Module 6: React Component Types: Objectives and Outcomes

In this lesson you will learn about various types of React components:
Presentational, Container and Functional components. At the end of this
lesson you will be able to:

-   Identify the salient features and uses for the various types of
    components

-   Create presentational, container and functional components in your
    React application

## Presentational and Container Components

Notes

## Exercise (Video): Presentational and Container Components

## Exercise (Instructions): Presentational and Container Components

### Objectives and Outcomes

In this exercise we understand about how presentational components deal
with the look and feel of the app and container components deal with the
data and behavior. At the end of this exercise you will learn about:

-   Organizing your React app into presentational and container
    components

-   Enable your presentational components to be concerned with the look
    and feel of your app

-   Enable container components to deal with the state, provide the data
    and handle user interactions.

### Add a Container Component

-   Add a new component named <i>MainComponent.js</i> in the components
    folder and update its contents as follows:

```
> import React, { Component } from 'react';
> import { Navbar, NavbarBrand } from 'reactstrap';
> import Menu from './MenuComponent';
> import DishDetail from './DishdetailComponent';
> import { DISHES } from '../shared/dishes';
>  
> class Main extends Component {
>  
>   constructor(props) {
>     super(props);
>     this.state = {
>         dishes: DISHES,
>         selectedDish: null
>     };
>   }
>  
>   onDishSelect(dishId) {
>     this.setState({ selectedDish: dishId});
>   }
>  
>   render() {
>     return (
>       <div>
>         <Navbar dark color="primary">
>           <div className="container">
>             <NavbarBrand href="/">Ristorante Con Fusion</NavbarBrand>
>           </div>
>         </Navbar>
>         <Menu dishes={this.state.dishes} onClick={(dishId) => this.onDishSelect(dishId)} />
>         <DishDetail dish={this.state.dishes.filter((dish) => dish.id === this.state.selectedDish)[0]} />
>       </div>
>     );
>   }
> }
>  
> export default Main;
```

-   Update the <i>App.js</i> by removing the state related information, and
    make use of Main Component to render the UI:

```
> . . .
> import Main from './components/MainComponent';
>  
> class App extends Component {
>  
>   render() {
>     return (
>       <div className="App">
>         <Main />
>       </div>
>     );
>   }
> }
>  
> . . .
```

### Turn Menu Component into a Presentational Component

-   Open MenuComponent.js and update its contents by removing the state
    and removing the DishdetailComponent reference, and make use of the
    onClick supplied by MainComponent through the props to deal with the
    clicking of a menu item:

```
> . . .
>                     <Card key={dish.id}
>                         onClick={() => this.props.onClick(dish.id)}>
> . . .
```

-   The DishdetailComponent is already structured as a presentational
    component and hence needs no further update, except wrapping the
    return value from render() within a \<div\> with the className as
    container.

-   To print out the date for a comment in a format more suitable for
    human readability, you can update your renderComment function with
    the code snippet shown below:

```
> {new Intl.DateTimeFormat('en-US', { year: 'numeric', month: 'short', day: '2-digit'}).format(new Date(Date.parse(comment.date)))}
```

-   Save all the changes and do a Git commit with the message
    "Presentational and Container Components"

### Conclusions

In this exercise you learnt how to structure your app into
presentational and container components.

## React Components: Lifecycle Methods Part 2

## Functional Components

## Exercise (Video): Functional Components

## Exercise (Instructions): Functional Components

### Objectives and Outcomes

In this lesson we explore the design of functional components in React.
We will reimplement both the MenuComponent and DishdetailComponent as
pure functional components. At the end of this exercise you will be able
to:

-   Implement functional components in React

-   Illustrate the reimplementation of presentational components as pure
    functional components

### Implementing Functional Components

-   Open MenuComponent.js and update it as follows:

```
> import React from 'react';
> import { Card, CardImg, CardImgOverlay,
>     CardTitle } from 'reactstrap';
>  
>     function RenderMenuItem ({dish, onClick}) {
>         return (
>             <Card
>                 onClick={() => onClick(dish.id)}>
>                 <CardImg width="100%" src={dish.image} alt={dish.name} />
>                 <CardImgOverlay>
>                     <CardTitle>{dish.name}</CardTitle>
>                 </CardImgOverlay>
>             </Card>
>         );
>     }
>
>     const Menu = (props) => {
>  
>         const menu = props.dishes.map((dish) => {
>             return (
>                 <div className="col-12 col-md-5 m-1"  key={dish.id}>
>                     <RenderMenuItem dish={dish} onClick={props.onClick} />
>                 </div>
>             );
>         });
>  
>         return (
>             <div className="container">
>                 <div className="row">
>                     {menu}
>                 </div>
>             </div>
>         );
>     }
>  
> export default Menu;
```

-   Then open DishdetailComponent.js and update it as follows:

```
> import React from 'react';
> import { Card, CardImg, CardText, CardBody,
>     CardTitle } from 'reactstrap';
>     function RenderDish({dish}) {
>       . . .
>     }
>     function RenderComments({comments}) {
>       . . .
>     }
>     const  DishDetail = (props) => {
>       . . .
>     }
> export default DishDetail;
```

-   Save all the changes and do a Git commit with the message
    "Functional Components".

### Conclusions

In this exercise we have learnt to implement our components as pure functional components.

## Module 8: React Router: Objectives and Outcomes

In this lesson we cover the basics of React router. We examine how the
router enables the navigation among views of various components that
form part of a React application. At the end of this lesson you will be
able to:

-   Set up the router module to enable navigation among multiple
    component views

-   Set up the routes to enable the navigation

## React Virtual DOM

## Exercise (Video): Header and Footer

## Exercise (Instructions): Header and Footer

### Objectives and Outcomes

In this exercise you will add in a header and a footer to our React
application using two React components. This will illustrate the use of
multiple components put together form the application\'s view. You will
also add in the Font Awesome icons and Bootstrap-social for use within
your application. At the end of this exercise you will be able to:

-   Use multiple components and their views to put together the view of
    the application.

-   Make use of Font Awesome icons and Bootstrap-social within your
    React application

### Using Font Awesome Icons and Bootstrap-Social

-   First use yarn or npm to fetch Font Awesome and Bootstrap-social to
    the project by typing the following at the prompt:

```
> yarn add font-awesome@4.7.0
> yarn add bootstrap-social@5.1.1
```

-   Then, open index.js file and update it as follows to enable your
    application to use Font Awesome and Bootstrap Social:

```
> . . .
>  
> import \'font-awesome/css/font-awesome.css\';
> import \'bootstrap-social/bootstrap-social.css\';
>  
> . . .
```

### Adding a Header and a Footer

-   Create a new file named HeaderComponent.js and add the following to
    it:

```
> import React, { Component } from 'react';
> import { Navbar, NavbarBrand, Jumbotron } from 'reactstrap';
>  
> class Header extends Component {
>   render() {
>     return(
>     <React.Fragment>
>       <Navbar dark>
>         <div className="container">
>             <NavbarBrand href="/">Ristorante Con Fusion</NavbarBrand>
>         </div>
>       </Navbar>
>       <Jumbotron>
>            <div className="container">
>                <div className="row row-header">
>                    <div className="col-12 col-sm-6">
>                        <h1>Ristorante con Fusion</h1>
>                       <p>We take inspiration from the World's best cuisines, and create a unique fusion experience. Our lipsmacking creations will tickle your culinary senses!</p>
>                    </div>
>                </div>
>            </div>
>        </Jumbotron>
>     </React.Fragment>
>     );
>   }
> }
>  
> export default Header;
```

-   Then, add another file named FooterComponent.js and add the
    following to it:

```
> import React from 'react';
>  
> function Footer(props) {
>     return(
>     <div className="footer">
>         <div className="container">
>             <div className="row justify-content-center\"\>             
>                 <div className="col-4 offset-1 col-sm-2\"\>

```

### Integrating Header and Footer into the React Application

-   Now we open MainComponent.js and update it to integrate the header
    and footer into our application:

```
> . . .
>
>  
>
> import Header from \'./HeaderComponent\';
>
> import Footer from \'./FooterComponent\';
>
>  
>
> . . .
>
>  
>
>         \<Header /\>
>
>         \<Menu dishes={this.state.dishes} onClick={(dishId) =\> this.onDishSelect(dishId)} /\>
>
>         \<DishDetail dish={this.state.dishes.filter((dish) =\> dish.id === this.state.selectedDish)\[0\]} /\>
>
>         \<Footer /\>
>
>         
>
> . . .

-   Then update App.css to add some new CSS classes for use in our
    application:

> .row-header{
>
>     margin:0px auto;
>
>     padding:0px auto;
>
> }
>
>  
>
> .row-content {
>
>     margin:0px auto;
>
>     padding: 50px 0px 50px 0px;
>
>     border-bottom: 1px ridge;
>
>     min-height:400px;
>
> }
>
>  
>
> .footer{
>
>     background-color: #D1C4E9;
>
>     margin:0px auto;
>
>     padding: 20px 0px 20px 0px;
>
> }
>
> .jumbotron {
>
>     padding:70px 30px 70px 30px;
>
>     margin:0px auto;
>
>     background: #9575CD ;
>
>     color:floralwhite;
>
> }
>
>  
>
> address{
>
>     font-size:80%;
>
>     margin:0px;
>
>     color:#0f0f0f;
>
> }

-   Save all the changes and do a Git commit with the message \"Header
    and Footer\"

### Conclusions

In this exercise we updated the React application to use Font Awesome
and Bootstrap Social, and also integrated two new components, Header and
Footer, into our application.

## React Router

## Exercise (Video): React Router

## Exercise (Instructions): React Router

### Objectives and Outcomes

In this exercise we learn to use the React Router to configure and set
up navigation among various pages in a React application. At the end of
this exercise you will be able to:

-   Install and configure your application to use React Router

-   Configure the routes for React router to enable you to navigate to
    various pages within your React application

### Installing and Configuring React Router

-   First install React Router into your project by typing the following
    at the prompt:

> yarn add react-router-dom@4.2.2

-   Then, open <i>App.js</i> and update it as follows:

```
> . . .
>
>  
>
> import { BrowserRouter } from \'react-router-dom\';
>
>  
>
> . . .
>
>  
>
>     \<BrowserRouter\>
>
>       \<div className=\"App\"\>
>
>         \<Main /\>
>
>       \</div\>
>
>     \</BrowserRouter\>
>
>     
>
> . . .
```

### Add a Home Component

-   Create a new file named HomeComponent.js in the components folder
    and add the following to it:

```
> import React from \'react\';
>
>  
>
> function Home(props) {
>
>     return(
>
>       \<div className=\"container\"\>
>
>         \<h4\>Home\</h4\>
>
>       \</div\>
>
>     );
>
> }
>
>  
>
> export default Home;   
```

### Configuring the Router

-   Open <i>MainComponent.js</i> file and update it as follows:

```
> . . .
>
> import Home from \'./HomeComponent\';
>
> . . .
>
> import { Switch, Route, Redirect } from \'react-router-dom\';
>
> . . .
>
>   render() {
>
>     const HomePage = () =\> {
>       return(
>           \<Home 
>           /\>
>       );
>     }
>
> . . .
>           \<Switch\>
>               \<Route path=\'/home\' component={HomePage} /\>
>               \<Route exact path=\'/menu\' component={() =\> \<Menu dishes={this.state.dishes} /\>} /\>
>               \<Redirect to=\"/home\" /\>
>           \</Switch\>
>
> . . .
>
>  
```

-   Open <i>HeaderComponent.js</i> and update its contents with the
    following:

```
> import { Nav, Navbar, NavbarBrand, NavbarToggler, Collapse, NavItem, Jumbotron } from \'reactstrap\';
>
> import { NavLink } from \'react-router-dom\';
>
>  
>
> class Header extends Component {
>
>     constructor(props) {
>
>         super(props);
>
>     
>
>         this.toggleNav = this.toggleNav.bind(this);
>
>         this.state = {
>
>           isNavOpen: false
>
>         };
>
>       }
>
>  
>
>       toggleNav() {
>
>         this.setState({
>
>           isNavOpen: !this.state.isNavOpen
>
>         });
>
>       }
>
>  
>
>     render() {
>
>         return(
>
>             \<div\>
>
>                 \<Navbar dark expand=\"md\"\>
>
>                     \<div className=\"container\"\>
>
>                         \<NavbarToggler onClick={this.toggleNav} /\>
>
> \<NavbarBrand className=\"mr-auto\" href=\"/\"\>\<img src=\'assets/images/logo.png\' height=\"30\" width=\"41\" alt=\'Ristorante Con Fusion\' /\>\</NavbarBrand\>
>
>                         \<Collapse isOpen={this.state.isNavOpen} navbar\>
>
>                             \<Nav navbar\>
>
>                             \<NavItem\>
>
> \<NavLink className=\"nav-link\"  to=\'/home\'\>\<span className=\"fa fa-home fa-lg\"\>\</span\> Home\</NavLink\>
>
>                             \</NavItem\>
>
>                             \<NavItem\>
>
> \<NavLink className=\"nav-link\" to=\'/aboutus\'\>\<span className=\"fa fa-info fa-lg\"\>\</span\> About Us\</NavLink\>
>
>                             \</NavItem\>
>
>                             \<NavItem\>
>
>  \<NavLink className=\"nav-link\"  to=\'/menu\'\>\<span className=\"fa fa-list fa-lg\"\>\</span\> Menu\</NavLink\>
>
>                             \</NavItem\>
>
>                             \<NavItem\>
>
> \<NavLink className=\"nav-link\" to=\'/contactus\'\>\<span className=\"fa fa-address-card fa-lg\"\>\</span\> Contact Us\</NavLink\>
>
>                             \</NavItem\>
```

-   Then, open FooterComponent.js and update it as follows:

```
> . . .
>
>  
>
> import { Link } from \'react-router-dom\';
>
>  
>
> . . .
>
>  
>
>                         \<li\>\<Link to=\'/home\'\>Home\</Link\>\</li\>
>
>                         \<li\>\<Link to=\'/aboutus\'\>About Us\</Link\>\</li\>
>
>                         \<li\>\<Link to=\'/menu\'\>Menu\</Link\>\</li\>
>
>                         \<li\>\<Link to=\'/contactus\'\>Contact Us\</Link\>\</li\>
>
>                         
>
> . . .
```

-   Open MenuComponent.js and remove the onClick() from the Card in the
    RenderMenuItem() function.

-   Save all the changes and do a Git commit with the message \"React
    Router\".

### Conclusions

### Integrating the Contact Component

-   Add a new file named <i>ContactComponent.js</i> file and update its
    contents as follows:

```
> import React from \'react\';
>
> function Contact(props) {
>     return(
>         \<div className=\"container\"\>
>             \<div className=\"row row-content\"\>
>                 \<div className=\"col-12\"\>
>                 \<h3\>Location Information\</h3\>
>                 \</div\>
>                 \<div className=\"col-12 col-sm-4 offset-sm-1\"\>

>  
>
>               \<Route exact path=\'/contactus\' component={Contact} /\>} /\>
>
>  
```

### Updating the Home Component

-   First update <i>dishes.js</i> file in the shared folder to update the
    dishes as follows. (<b>NOTE</b>: Alternately you can download
    <i>dishes.js, comments.js, promotions.js</i> and <i>leaders.js</i> given above
    in Exercise resources and move them to the shared folder):

```
> export const DISHES =

-   Now update the HomeComponent.ts file to fetch and display the
    featured dish, promotion and leader as follows:

```
> import React from \'react\';
> import { Card, CardImg, CardText, CardBody,
>     CardTitle, CardSubtitle} from \'reactstrap\';
> function RenderCard({item}) {

>                 \</div\>
>             \</div\>
>         \</div\>
>     );
> }
> export default Home;
```

-   Next, update MainComponent.js as follows:

```
> . . .
> import { COMMENTS } from \'../shared/comments\';
> import { PROMOTIONS } from \'../shared/promotions\';
> import { LEADERS } from \'../shared/leaders\';

>           /\>
>       );
>     }
> . . .
```

-   Save all the changes and do a Git commit with the message \"Single
    Page Applications Part 1\".

### Conclusions

In this exercise you developed the Angular application further by
integrating the components into a single page application.

## Module 7: React Router: Parameters

## Exercise (Video): Single Page Applications Part 2

## Exercise (Instructions): Single Page Applications Part 2

### Objectives and Outcomes

In this exercise you will integrate the DishdetailComponent into your
single page application. You will use a route parameter in the URL to
pass in the details of the selected dish to the DishdetailComponent. At
the end of this exercise you will be able to:

-   Configure the routes in your React router configuration to enable
    the use of route parameters within the URL to pass information to a
    component.

### Updating to Use Parameters on Routes

-   Open <i>MenuComponent.js</i> and add the following changes to it to
    enable the information about the selected dish to be passed to the
    DishdetailComponent:

```
. . .
>  
> import { Card, CardImg, CardImgOverlay,
>     CardTitle, Breadcrumb, BreadcrumbItem } from \'reactstrap\';
> import { Link } from \'react-router-dom\';
>
>     function RenderMenuItem ({dish, onClick}) {
>         return (
>             \<Card\>
>                 \<Link to={\`/menu/\${dish.id}\`} \>
>                     \<CardImg width=\"100%\" src={dish.image} alt={dish.name} /\>
>                     \<CardImgOverlay\>
>                         \<CardTitle\>{dish.name}\</CardTitle\>
>                     \</CardImgOverlay\>

<b>Assignment Resources</b>

<b>AboutComponent</b>

JS File

<b>Objectives and Outcomes</b>

At the end of this assignment, you should have completed the following
tasks:

-   Integrated the AboutComponent given above into the single page
    > application.

-   Added a new functional component named \<RenderLeader\> through the
    > RenderLeader() function to AboutComponent.js that renders the
    > details of a given leader using the reactstrap \<Media\>
    > component.

-   Construct and render the list of leaders in the About Us page using
    > the \<RenderLeader\> component implemented above.

<b>Assignment Requirements</b>

This assignment requires you to complete the following tasks. Detailed
instructions for each task are given below. The picture of the completed
web page included below indicates the location within the web page that
will be updated by the three tasks.

<b>Task 1</b>

In this task you will be integrating the AboutComponent into the single
page application:

-   First, download the <i>AboutComponent.js</i> given above and move it to
    > the components folder, and

-   Update the <i>MainComponent.js</i> file to integrate the AboutComponent
    > into the single page application. You should be able to navigate
    > to the AboutComponent by clicking the links in the navigation bar
    > and the footer.

<b>Task 2</b>

In this task you will implement a new functional component named
\<RenderLeader\> through the RenderLeader() function:

-   The RenderLeader() function receives the details of a leader as its
    > parameter,

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Implement RenderLeader() function to use the Leader information
    > received as a parameter and render the leader information as shown
    > in the screenshot below using the reactstrap \<Media\> component.
    > Recall how we used the \<Media\> component in the first module to
    > render the details of a dish in the MenuComponent.

-   This will make available the \<RenderLeader\> component for use
    > within your AboutComponent.

<b>Task 3</b>

In this task you will use the \<RenderLeader\> component created in the
previous task to render a list of leaders within your AboutComponent:

-   Update the leaders variable within the AboutComponent() function to
    > make use of the \<RenderLeader\> component to render the list of
    > leaders.

## UI Design and Prototyping: Objectives and Outcomes

Now that you are more clear about your project idea, it\'s time to
conceive how your project is going to look like for the end-users. This
is the time to design the user interface and the flow of your
application. User interface design and prototyping helps you to
conceptualize the look and feel of your application. This can be
achieved in two ways: using wireframe diagrams, or using prototyping
tools. We provide links to wireframing and prototyping tools in the
additional resources. The focus in this lesson is to be able to visually
represent various UI elements to enable designing your application. The
aim is to deliver a reasonable representation of the end-user experience
with your application At the end of this lesson, you should be able to:

-   Construct a wireframe diagram to visually represent the structure of
    your user interface

-   Construct a prototype to enable understanding the flow of your
    application

## Controlled Forms: Objectives and Outcomes

In this lesson you will learn about controlled components and how they
can be used to design controlled forms in your React application. At the
end of this exercise you will be able to:

-   Design a controlled form in your React application.

## Controlled Forms

## Exercise (Video): Controlled Forms

## Exercise (Instructions): Controlled Forms

### Objectives and Outcomes

In this exercise you will learn about using controlled components to
design controlled forms in your React application. At the end of this
exercise you will be able to:

-   Design a controlled form in your React application.

### Importing the Necessary Components

-   You will start out by importing the necessary components from
    reactstrap into <i>ContactComponent.js</i> as follows:

```
> . . .
> import React, { Component } from \'react\';
> import { Breadcrumb, BreadcrumbItem,
>             Button, Form, FormGroup, Label, Input, Col } from \'reactstrap\';
>   . . .
```

-   You will then change the <i>ContactComponent</i> to a class-based
    component as follows:

```
> . . .
> class Contact extends Component {
>   render() {
>     . . .
>   }
> }
```

### Creating the Controlled Form

-   Update the <i>ContactComponent.js</i> file as follows to set up the
    Controlled Form:

```
> . . .
>     constructor(props) {
>         super(props);
>         this.state = {
>             firstname: \'\',
>             lastname: \'\',
>             telnum: \'\',
>             email: \'\',
>             agree: false,
>             contactType: \'Tel.\',
>             message: \'\'
>         };
>         this.handleInputChange = this.handleInputChange.bind(this);
>         this.handleSubmit = this.handleSubmit.bind(this);
>     }
>     handleInputChange(event) {
>         const target = event.target;
>         const value = target.type === \'checkbox\' ? target.checked : target.value;
>         const name = target.name;
>         this.setState({
>           \[name\]: value
>         });
>     }
>     handleSubmit(event) {
>         console.log(\'Current State is: \' + JSON.stringify(this.state));
>         alert(\'Current State is: \' + JSON.stringify(this.state));
>         event.preventDefault();
>     }
> . . .
>  
```

-   Then add the controlled form to it as follows:

```
> . . .
>                 \<div className=\"row row-content\"\>
>                    \<div className=\"col-12\"\>
>                       \<h3\>Send us your Feedback\</h3\>
>                    \</div\>
>                     \<div className=\"col-12 col-md-9\"\>
>                         \<Form onSubmit={this.handleSubmit}\>
>                             \<FormGroup row\>
>                                 \<Label htmlFor=\"firstname\" md={2}\>First Name\</Label\>
>                                 \<Col md={10}\>
>                                     \<Input type=\"text\" id=\"firstname\" name=\"firstname\"
>                                         placeholder=\"First Name\"
>                                         value={this.state.firstname}
>                                         onChange={this.handleInputChange} /\>
>                                 \</Col\>
>                             \</FormGroup\>
>                             \<FormGroup row\>
>                                 \<Label htmlFor=\"lastname\" md={2}\>Last Name\</Label\>
>                                 \<Col md={10}\>
>                                     \<Input type=\"text\" id=\"lastname\" name=\"lastname\"
>                                         placeholder=\"Last Name\"
>                                         value={this.state.lastname}
>                                         onChange={this.handleInputChange} /\>
>                                 \</Col\>                        
>                             \</FormGroup\>
>                             \<FormGroup row\>
>                             \<Label htmlFor=\"telnum\" md={2}\>Contact Tel.\</Label\>
>                                 \<Col md={10}\>
>                                     \<Input type=\"tel\" id=\"telnum\" name=\"telnum\"
>                                         placeholder=\"Tel. number\"
>                                         value={this.state.telnum}
>                                         onChange={this.handleInputChange} /\>
>                                 \</Col\>
>                             \</FormGroup\>
>                             \<FormGroup row\>
>                                 \<Label htmlFor=\"email\" md={2}\>Email\</Label\>
>                                 \<Col md={10}\>
>                                     \<Input type=\"email\" id=\"email\" name=\"email\"
>
>                                         placeholder=\"Email\"

-   Save all changes and do a Git commit with the message \"Controlled
    Forms\".

### Conclusions

In this exercise you have learnt to create a controlled form within your
React application.

## Exercise (Video): Controlled Form Validation

## Exercise (Instructions): Controlled Form Validation

### Objectives and Outcomes

In this exercise you will be introduced to simple form validation for
controlled forms in React. At the end of this exercise you will be able
to:

-   Configure and perform simple form validation for your controlled
    forms

### Simple Form Validation

-   Open <i>ContactComponent.js</i> and update it as follows to introduce the
    support to track form errors and perform validation:

> . . .
>
> import { Breadcrumb, BreadcrumbItem, Button, Form, FormGroup, Label, Input, Col, Row, FormFeedback } from \'reactstrap\';
>
> . . .
>
>  
>
> class Contact extends Component {
>
>  
>
>     constructor(props) {
>
>         super(props);
>
>  
>
>         this.state = {
>
>             firstname: \'\',
>
>             lastname: \'\',
>
>             telnum: \'\',
>
>             email: \'\',
>
>             agree: false,
>
>             contactType: \'Tel.\',
>
>             message: \'\',
>
>             touched: {
>
>                 firstname: false,
>
>                 lastname: false,
>
>                 telnum: false,
>
>                 email: false
>
>             }
>
>         }
>
>         this.handleSubmit = this.handleSubmit.bind(this);
>
>         this.handleInputChange = this.handleInputChange.bind(this);
>
>         this.handleBlur = this.handleBlur.bind(this);
>
>     }
>
>     
>
>     . . .
>
>     
>
>     handleBlur = (field) =\> (evt) =\> {
>
>         this.setState({
>
>             touched: { \...this.state.touched, \[field\]: true }
>
>         });
>
>     }
>
>  
>
>     validate(firstname, lastname, telnum, email) {
>
>         const errors = {
>
>             firstname: \'\',

-   Now that we have introduced some functions that can be used for form
    validation, let us update the form itself to make use of these as
    follows:

> . . .
>
>  
>
>                             \<FormGroup row\>
>
>                                 \<Label htmlFor=\"firstname\" md={2}\>First Name\</Label\>
>
>                                 \<Col md={10}\>
>
>                                     \<Input type=\"text\" id=\"firstname\" name=\"firstname\"
>
>                                         placeholder=\"First Name\"
>
>                                         value={this.state.firstname}
>
>                                         valid={errors.firstname === \'\'}
>
>                                         invalid={errors.firstname !== \'\'}
>
>                                         onBlur={this.handleBlur(\'firstname\')}
>
>                                         onChange={this.handleInputChange} /\>
>
>                                     \<FormFeedback\>{errors.firstname}\</FormFeedback\>
>
>                                 \</Col\>
>
>                             \</FormGroup\>
>
>                             \<FormGroup row\>
>
>                                 \<Label htmlFor=\"lastname\" md={2}\>Last Name\</Label\>
>
>                                 \<Col md={10}\>
>
>                                     \<Input type=\"text\" id=\"lastname\" name=\"lastname\"
>
>                                         placeholder=\"Last Name\"
>
>                                         value={this.state.lastname}
>
>                                         valid={errors.lastname === \'\'}
>
>                                         invalid={errors.lastname !== \'\'}
>
>                                         onBlur={this.handleBlur(\'lastname\')}
>
>                                         onChange={this.handleInputChange} /\>
>
>                                     \<FormFeedback\>{errors.lastname}\</FormFeedback\>
>
>                                 \</Col\>
>
>                             \</FormGroup\>
>
>                             \<FormGroup row\>
>
>                                 \<Label htmlFor=\"telnum\" md={2}\>Contact Tel.\</Label\>
>
>                                 \<Col md={10}\>
>
>                                     \<Input type=\"tel\" id=\"telnum\" name=\"telnum\"
>
>                                         placeholder=\"Tel. Number\"
>
>                                         value={this.state.telnum}
>
>                                         valid={errors.telnum === \'\'}
>
>                                         invalid={errors.telnum !== \'\'}
>
>                                         onBlur={this.handleBlur(\'telnum\')}
>
>                                         onChange={this.handleInputChange} /\>
>
>                                     \<FormFeedback\>{errors.telnum}\</FormFeedback\>
>
>                                 \</Col\>

-   You can now test your form by typing in invalid input and check how
    the form validation works.

-   Save all the changes and do a Git commit with the message
    \"Controlled Form Validation\"

### Conclusions

In this exercise you have learnt about doing simple form validation for
controlled forms in React.

## Module 8: Uncontrolled Forms: Objectives and Outcomes

Forms in React can be approached in two ways, either through
uncontrolled components, or controlled components. In this lesson we
will deal with uncontrolled forms. At the end of this lesson you will be
able to:

-   Create uncontrolled forms through uncontrolled components in React

-   Handle the form submission in the React application

## Uncontrolled Components

## Exercise (Video): Uncontrolled Forms

## Exercise (Instructions): Uncontrolled Forms

In this exercise we will create an uncontrolled form within our React
application using the uncontrolled component approach. At the end of
this exercise you will be able to:

-   Create uncontrolled forms through uncontrolled components in React

-   Handle the form submission in the React application

### Adding a Modal to Host the Form

-   Update <i>HeaderComponent.js</i> as follows to add a new Modal to the
    application to host the form:

> . . .
>
>  
>
> import { Navbar, NavbarBrand, Nav, NavbarToggler, Collapse, NavItem, Jumbotron,
>
>     Button, Modal, ModalHeader, ModalBody,
>
>     Form, FormGroup, Input, Label } from \'reactstrap\';
>
>             
>
> . . .
>
>  
>
>         this.state = {
>
>             isNavOpen: false,
>
>             isModalOpen: false
>
>         };
>
>         
>
> . . .
>
>  
>
>         this.toggleModal = this.toggleModal.bind(this);
>
>  
>
> . . .
>
>  
>
>  
>
>       toggleModal() {
>
>         this.setState({
>
>           isModalOpen: !this.state.isModalOpen
>
>         });
>
>       }
>
>       
>
> . . .
>
>  
>
>                 \<Modal isOpen={this.state.isModalOpen} toggle={this.toggleModal}\>
>
>                     \<ModalHeader toggle={this.toggleModal}\>Login\</ModalHeader\>
>
>                     \<ModalBody\>
>
>                     
>
>                     \</ModalBody\>
>
>                 \</Modal\>
>
>                 
>
> . . .

-   Then, add a button to the Navbar to enable toggling the modal:

> . . .
>
>  
>
>                             \<Nav className=\"ml-auto\" navbar\>
>
>                                 \<NavItem\>
>
>                                     \<Button outline onClick={this.toggleModal}\>\<span className=\"fa fa-sign-in fa-lg\"\>\</span\> Login\</Button\>
>
>                                 \</NavItem\>
>
>                             \</Nav\>
>
>                             
>
> . . .

### Adding the Uncontrolled Form

-   Add the form to the modal body as shown below:

. . .

>  
>
>                         \<Form onSubmit={this.handleLogin}\>
>
>                             \<FormGroup\>
>
>                                 \<Label htmlFor=\"username\"\>Username\</Label\>
>
>                                 \<Input type=\"text\" id=\"username\" name=\"username\"
>
>                                     innerRef={(input) =\> this.username = input} /\>
>
>                             \</FormGroup\>
>
>                             \<FormGroup\>
>
>                                 \<Label htmlFor=\"password\"\>Password\</Label\>
>
>                                 \<Input type=\"password\" id=\"password\" name=\"password\"
>
>                                     innerRef={(input) =\> this.password = input}  /\>
>
>                             \</FormGroup\>
>
>                             \<FormGroup check\>
>
>                                 \<Label check\>
>
>                                     \<Input type=\"checkbox\" name=\"remember\"
>
>                                     innerRef={(input) =\> this.remember = input}  /\>
>
>                                     Remember me
>
>                                 \</Label\>
>
>                             \</FormGroup\>
>
>                             \<Button type=\"submit\" value=\"submit\" color=\"primary\"\>Login\</Button\>
>
>                         \</Form\>
>
>                         
>
> . . .

-   Then, add the following function to the class to handle the form
    submission:

> . . .
>
>  
>
>         this.handleLogin = this.handleLogin.bind(this);
>
> . . .
>
>  
>
>     handleLogin(event) {
>
>         this.toggleModal();
>
>         alert(\"Username: \" + this.username.value + \" Password: \" + this.password.value
>
>             + \" Remember: \" + this.remember.checked);
>
>         event.preventDefault();
>
>  
>
>     }
>
>       
>
> . . .

-   Save all the changes and do a Git commit with the message
    \"Uncontrolled Form\"

### Conclusions

In this exercise we learnt to use an uncontrolled component approach to
add a form to our React application.

## Introduction to Redux: Objectives and Outcomes

In this lesson you will learn about the Flux architecture as a way of
structuring your React application. You will also be introduced to
Redux, a realization of the flux architecture. At the end of this lesson
you will be able to:

-   Install and Configure Redux in your application

-   Enable your React app to make use of Redux

## Module 9: The Model-View-Controller Framework

## Module 10: The Flux Architecture

## Module xx: Introduction to Redux

## Chapter 1: Exercise (Video): Introduction to Redux

## Chapter 2: Exercise (Instructions): Introduction to Redux

### Objectives and Outcomes

In this exercise you will learn to use Redux. You will install and
configure Redux and use it within your React application. At the end of
this exercise you will be able to:

-   Install and configure Redux within your application

-   Configure your React application to make use of Redux

### Installing and Configuring Redux

-   As a first step you will install Redux and React-Redux into your
    application as follows:

> yarn add redux@3.7.2
>
> yarn add react-redux@5.0.7

-   Next, create a folder named <i>redux</i> in the <i>src</i> folder and then add
    a file named <i>reducer.js</i> with the code below:

> import { DISHES } from \'../shared/dishes\';
>
> import { COMMENTS } from \'../shared/comments\';
>
> import { PROMOTIONS } from \'../shared/promotions\';
>
> import { LEADERS } from \'../shared/leaders\';
>
>  
>
> export const initialState = {
>
>     dishes: DISHES,
>
>     comments: COMMENTS,
>
>     promotions: PROMOTIONS,
>
>     leaders: LEADERS
>
> };
>
>  
>
> export const Reducer = (state = initialState, action) =\> {
>
>     return state;
>
> };

-   Then, add a file named <i>configureStore.js</i> in the <i>redux</i> folder and
    add the following code to it:

> import {createStore} from \'redux\';
>
> import { Reducer, initialState } from \'./reducer\'
>
>  
>
> export const ConfigureStore = () =\> {
>
>     const store = createStore(
>
>         Reducer, // reducer
>
>         initialState, // our initialState
>
>     );
>
>  
>
>     return store;
>
> }

-   Next, open <i>App.js</i> and update it as follows:

> . . .
>
>  
>
>  
>
> import { Provider } from \'react-redux\';
>
> import { ConfigureStore } from \'./redux/configureStore\';
>
>  
>
> const store = ConfigureStore();
>
>  
>
>  
>
> . . .
>
>  
>
>       \<Provider store={store}\>
>
>         \<BrowserRouter\>
>
>           \<div className=\"App\"\>
>
>             \<Main /\>
>
>           \</div\>
>
>         \</BrowserRouter\>
>
>       \</Provider\>
>
>  
>
> . . .

-   Finally, update MainComponent.js to connect it to Redux store and
    use it:

> . . .
>
>  
>
> import { Switch, Route, Redirect, withRouter } from \'react-router-dom\'
>
> import { connect } from \'react-redux\';
>
>  
>
>  
>
> const mapStateToProps = state =\> {
>
>   return {
>
>     dishes: state.dishes,
>
>     comments: state.comments,
>
>     promotions: state.promotions,
>
>     leaders: state.leaders
>
>   }
>
> }
>
>  
>
> . . .
>
>  
>
>     const HomePage = () =\> {
>
>       return(
>
>           \<Home 
>
>               dish={this.props.dishes.filter((dish) =\> dish.featured)\[0\]}
>
>               promotion={this.props.promotions.filter((promo) =\> promo.featured)\[0\]}
>
>               leader={this.props.leaders.filter((leader) =\> leader.featured)\[0\]}
>
>           /\>
>
>       );
>
>     }
>
>  
>
>     const DishWithId = ({match}) =\> {
>
>       return(
>
>           \<DishDetail dish={this.props.dishes.filter((dish) =\> dish.id === parseInt(match.params.dishId,10))\[0\]} 
>
>             comments={this.props.comments.filter((comment) =\> comment.dishId === parseInt(match.params.dishId,10))} /\>
>
>       );
>
>     };
>
>  
>
>     return (
>
>       \<div\>
>
>         \<Header /\>
>
>         \<div\>
>
>           \<Switch\>
>
>               \<Route path=\'/home\' component={HomePage} /\>

-   Save all the changes and do a Git commit with the message \"Intro.
    to Redux\".

In this task you will add a new class component named CommentForm. You
need to complete the following:

-   Add a new class component named CommentForm that will add a button
    > to the view as shown in the image below.

-   When the button is clicked, it toggles a modal that will display the
    > comment form.

-   The CommentForm component is used by the RenderComments function to
    > display the button for toggling the modal.

<b>Task 2</b>

In this task you will construct the form for users to submit their
comments as shown in the image below. You need to complete the
following:

-   Set up the form as a local form using the react-redux-form with the
    > three fields: author, rating and comment.

-   The rating field in the comment form is implemented using a select,
    > the author is implemented using a text field, while the comment
    > uses a textarea with six rows.

## Redux Actions: Objectives and Outcomes

In this lesson we will look at how to create redux actions and how
action creators can be designed to return the action objects. Thereafter
we look at how to dispatch actions. We also look at how to split the
reducer into simpler functions and combine them. At the end of this
exercise, you will be able to:

-   Define Redux actions

-   Create action creator functions that return action objects

-   Split the reducer function into multiple simpler functions and
    combine the reducer functions

## Module xx: Redux Actions

## Module xx: Exercise (Video): Combining Reducers

## Exercise (Instructions): Combining Reducers

### Objectives and Outcomes

In this exercise you will learn about how we can have separate reducers
managing parts of the state, and how they can be combined together to
manage the whole state. At the end of this exercise you will be able to:

-   Implement reducers that are responsible for only part of the state

-   Combine the reducers to manage the entire state

### Splitting the Reducer

-   In the redux folder, create a new file named dishes.js and add the
    following to it:

```
> import { DISHES } from \'../shared/dishes\';
>
> export const Dishes = (state = DISHES, action) =\> {
>     switch (action.type) {
>         default:
>           return state;
>       }
> };
```

-   Then, create a file named comments.js and add the following to it:

```
> import { COMMENTS } from \'../shared/comments\';
>
>  
>
> export const Comments = (state = COMMENTS, action) =\> {
>
>     switch (action.type) {
>
>  
>
>         default:
>
>           return state;
>
>       }
>
> };
```

-   Similarly, create a new file named promotions.js and add the
    following to it:

```
> import { PROMOTIONS } from \'../shared/promotions\';
>
>  
>
> export const Promotions = (state = PROMOTIONS, action) =\> {
>
>     switch (action.type) {
>
>         default:
>
>           return state;
>
>       }
>
> };
```

-   And finally, create a new file named leaders.js and add the
    following to it:

```
> import { LEADERS } from \'../shared/leaders\';
>
> export const Leaders = (state = LEADERS, action) =\> {
>     switch (action.type) {
>         default:
>           return state;
>       }
> };
```

-   Now that we have split the management of state into different
    reducers that manage partial state, we need to combine them
    together. Open configureStore.js and update it as follows:

```
> import {createStore, combineReducers} from \'redux\';
> import { Dishes } from \'./dishes\';
> import { Comments } from \'./comments\';
> import { Promotions } from \'./promotions\';
> import { Leaders } from \'./leaders\';
>
> export const ConfigureStore = () =\> {
>     const store = createStore(
>         combineReducers({
>             dishes: Dishes,
>             comments: Comments,
>             promotions: Promotions,
>             leaders: Leaders
>         })
>     );
>  
>     return store;
> }
```

-   Now we can safely delete the reducer.js file from the project.

-   Save all the changes and do a Git commit with the message
    \"Combining Reducers\".

### Conclusions

In this exercise we have learnt to split the reducer into multiple
reducers that manage partial state, and then combine them together.

## Module xx: Exercise (Video): Redux Actions

## Exercise (Instructions): Redux Actions

### Objectives and Outcomes

In this exercise we will learn to define various Redux actions and
implement the action creators to dispatch the actions to the Redux
store. At the end of this exercise you will be able to:

-   Define Redux actions and implement the action creators

-   Dispatch actions from the action creators to update the system state
    in the Redux store

### Creating Actions

-   In the <i>redux</i> folder create a new file named <i>ActionTypes.js</i> and
    add the following to it:

```
> export const ADD_COMMENT = \'ADD_COMMENT\';
```

-   Then, create a file named <i>ActionCreators.js</i> and add the following
    to it:

```
> import \<i> as ActionTypes from \'./ActionTypes\';
>
>  
>
> export const addComment = (dishId, rating, author, comment) =\> ({
>
>     type: ActionTypes.ADD_COMMENT,
>
>     payload: {
>
>         dishId: dishId,
>
>         rating: rating,
>         author: author,
>         comment: comment
>     }
> });
```

-   Next, update <i>comments.js</i> to initiate action when the action is
    dispatched by the ActionCreator as follows:

```
> import { COMMENTS } from \'../shared/comments\';
>
> import \</i> as ActionTypes from \'./ActionTypes\';
>
> export const Comments = (state = COMMENTS, action) =\> {
>     switch (action.type) {
>         case ActionTypes.ADD_COMMENT:
>             var comment = action.payload;
>             comment.id = state.length;
>             comment.date = new Date().toISOString();
>             console.log(\"Comment: \", comment);
>             return state.concat(comment);
>         default:
>           return state;
>       }
> };
```

-   Now update <i>MainComponent.js</i> to make the action available for use
    within the DishdetailComponent as follows:

```
> . . .
>
>  
> import { addComment } from \'../redux/ActionCreators\';
>
> . . .
>
>   const mapDispatchToProps = dispatch =\> ({
>
>     addComment: (dishId, rating, author, comment) =\> dispatch(addComment(dishId, rating, author, comment))
>
>   });
>
> . . .
>
>       \<DishDetail dish={this.props.dishes.filter((dish) =\> dish.id === parseInt(match.params.dishId,10))\[0\]}
>         comments={this.props.comments.filter((comment) =\> comment.dishId === parseInt(match.params.dishId,10))}
>         addComment={this.props.addComment}
>       /\>
>
> . . .
>
> export default withRouter(connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(Main));
```

-   Finally, update <i>DishdetailComponent.js</i> as follows to initiate the
    action upon the user submitting the comment form:

```
> . . .
>
>  
>
>   function RenderComments({comments, addComment, dishId}) {
>
>  
>
>  
>
>  
>
> . . .
>
>  
>
>       \<CommentForm dishId={dishId} addComment={addComment} /\>
>
>  
>
>  
>
> . . .
>
>  
>
>         this.props.addComment(this.props.dishId, values.rating, values.author, values.comment);
>
>  
>
>  
>
>  
>
> . . .
>
>  
>
>       \<RenderComments comments={props.comments}
>
>         addComment={props.addComment}
>
>         dishId={props.dish.id}
>
>       /\>
>
>  
>
> . . .
```

-   Save all the changes and do a Git commit with the message \"Redux
    Actions\"

### Conclusions

In this exercise we have learnt to create and dispatch actions to update
the system state in the Redux store.

allows you to write action creators that return a function instead of an
action. In this lesson you will see the use of redux thunk to return a
function. At the end of this lesson you will be able to:

-   Use Redux Thunk middleware to return a function instead of an action

-   Use a logger middleware to print a log of actions initiated on the
    Redux store.

allows you to write action creators that return a function instead of an
action. In this exercise you will see the use of redux thunk to return a
function. At the end of this exercise you will be able to:

-   Use Redux Thunk middleware to return a function instead of an action

-   Use a logger to print a log of actions initiated on the Redux store.

### Installing Redux Thunk and Logger

-   Install Redux Thunk and Logger as shown below:

```
> yarn add redux-thunk@2.2.0
>
> yarn add redux-logger@3.0.6
```

-   Then open <i>configureStore.js</i> and update it to use the Thunk and
    Logger as follows:

```
> import {createStore, combineReducers, applyMiddleware } from \'redux\';
>
> . . .
>
> import thunk from \'redux-thunk\';
> import logger from \'redux-logger\';
>
> . . .
>         combineReducers({
>             dishes: Dishes,
>             comments: Comments,
>             promotions: Promotions,
>             leaders: Leaders
>         }),
>         applyMiddleware(thunk, logger)
>
> . . .
```

-   Next, open <i>ActionTypes.js</i> and add new action types as follows:

```
. . .

export const DISHES_LOADING = \'DISHES_LOADING\';
export const DISHES_FAILED = \'DISHES_FAILED\';
export const ADD_DISHES = \'ADD_DISHES\';
```

-   Then open ActionCreators.js and add new actions:

```
> . . .
>
>  
>
> import { DISHES } from \'../shared/dishes\';
>
>  
>
> . . .
>
>  
>
>  
>
> export const fetchDishes = () =\> (dispatch) =\> {
>
>  
>
>     dispatch(dishesLoading(true));
>
>  
>
>     setTimeout(() =\> {
>
>         dispatch(addDishes(DISHES));
>
>     }, 2000);
>
> }
>
>  
>
> export const dishesLoading = () =\> ({
>
>     type: ActionTypes.DISHES_LOADING
>
> });
>
>  
>
> export const dishesFailed = (errmess) =\> ({
>
>     type: ActionTypes.DISHES_FAILED,
>
>     payload: errmess
>
> });
>
>  
>
> export const addDishes = (dishes) =\> ({
>
>     type: ActionTypes.ADD_DISHES,
>
>     payload: dishes
>
> });
```

-   Next, open dishes.js and add the code to respond to actions as
    follows:

```
> import \</i> as ActionTypes from \'./ActionTypes\';
>
>  
>
> export const Dishes = (state = { isLoading: true,
>
>     errMess: null,
>
>     dishes:\[\]}, action) =\> {
>
>     switch (action.type) {
>
>         case ActionTypes.ADD_DISHES:
>
>             return {\...state, isLoading: false, errMess: null, dishes: action.payload};
>
>  
>
>         case ActionTypes.DISHES_LOADING:
>
>             return {\...state, isLoading: true, errMess: null, dishes: \[\]}
>
>  
>
>         case ActionTypes.DISHES_FAILED:
>
>             return {\...state, isLoading: false, errMess: action.payload};
>
>  
>
>         default:
>
>             return state;
>
>     }
>
> };
```

-   Add a new component named <i>LoadingComponent.js</i> to display a loading
    message as follows:

```
> import React from \'react\';
>
>  
>
> export const Loading = () =\> {
>
>     return(
>
>         \<div className=\"col-12\"\>
>
>             \<span className=\"fa fa-spinner fa-pulse fa-3x fa-fw text-primary\"\>\</span\>
>
>             \<p\>Loading . . .\</p\>
>
>         \</div\>
>
>     );
>
> };
```

-   Now we will update the remaining components to use the actions.
    First, open <i>MainComponent.js</i> and update it as follows:

```
> . . .
> import { addComment, fetchDishes } from \'../redux/ActionCreators\';
> . . .
>   fetchDishes: () =\> { dispatch(fetchDishes())}
> . . .
>   componentDidMount() {
>     this.props.fetchDishes();
>   }
> . . .
>     const HomePage = () =\> {
>       return(
>           \<Home 
>               dish={this.props.dishes.dishes.filter((dish) =\> dish.featured)\[0\]}
>               dishesLoading={this.props.dishes.isLoading}
>               dishesErrMess={this.props.dishes.errMess}
>               promotion={this.props.promotions.filter((promo) =\> promo.featured)\[0\]}
>               leader={this.props.leaders.filter((leader) =\> leader.featured)\[0\]}
>           /\>
>       );
>     }
>     const DishWithId = ({match}) =\> {
>       return(
>\<DishDetail dish={this.props.dishes.dishes.filter((dish) =\> dish.id === parseInt(match.params.dishId,10))\[0\]}
>
>             isLoading={this.props.dishes.isLoading}
>             errMess={this.props.dishes.errMess}
> comments={this.props.comments.filter((comment) =\> comment.dishId === parseInt(match.params.dishId,10))}
>             addComment={this.props.addComment}
>           /\>
>       );
>     };
> . . .
```

-   Open <i>DishdetailComponent.js</i> and update it as follows:

```
> . . .
> import { Loading } from \'./LoadingComponent\';
> . . .
>         if (props.isLoading) {
>             return(
>                 \<div className=\"container\"\>
>                     \<div className=\"row\"\>            
>                         \<Loading /\>
>                     \</div\>
>                 \</div\>
>             );
>         }
>         else if (props.errMess) {
>             return(
>                 \<div className=\"container\"\>
>                     \<div className=\"row\"\>            
>                         \<h4\>{props.errMess}\</h4\>
>                     \</div\>
>                 \</div\>
>             );
>         }
>         else if (props.dish != null) 
> . . .
```

-   Open <i>HomeComponent.js</i> and update it as follows:

```
> . . .
> import { Loading } from \'./LoadingComponent\';
> . . .
>  
>
> function RenderCard({item, isLoading, errMess}) {
>
>     if (isLoading) {
>         return(
>                 \<Loading /\>
>         );
>     }
>     else if (errMess) {
>         return(
>                 \<h4\>{errMess}\</h4\>
>         );
>     }
>     else 
>         return(
>             \<Card\>
>
>                 \<CardImg src={item.image} alt={item.name} /\>
>                 \<CardBody\>
>                 \<CardTitle\>{item.name}\</CardTitle\>
>                 {item.designation ? \<CardSubtitle\>{item.designation}\</CardSubtitle\> : null }
>                 \<CardText\>{item.description}\</CardText\>
>                 \</CardBody\>
>             \</Card\>
>         );
> }
> . . .
> \<RenderCard item={props.dish} isLoading={props.dishesLoading} errMess={props.dishesErrMess}  /\>
>
> . . .
```

-   Finally, update <i>MenuComponent.js</i> as follows:

```
> . . .
> import { Loading } from \'./LoadingComponent\';
> . . .
>         const menu = props.dishes.dishes.map((dish) =\> {
> . . .
>
>         if (props.dishes.isLoading) {
>             return(
>                 \<div className=\"container\"\>
>                     \<div className=\"row\"\>            
>                         \<Loading /\>
>                     \</div\>
>                 \</div\>
>             );
>         }
>         else if (props.dishes.errMess) {
>             return(
>                 \<div className=\"container\"\>
>                     \<div className=\"row\"\> 
>                         \<div className=\"col-12\"\>
>                             \<h4\>{props.dishes.errMess}\</h4\>
>                         \</div\>
>                     \</div\>
>                 \</div\>
>             );
>         }
>         else
> . . .
```

-   Save all the changes and do a Git commit with the message \"Redux
    Thunk\".

### Conclusions

In this exercise we saw the use of Redux Thunk and the Logger.

## Exercise (Video): React-Redux-Form Revisited

## Exercise (Instructions): React-Redux-Form Revisited

### Objectives and Outcomes

In this exercise we will explore the interaction between
react-redux-form and the Redux store. We will see how to map the form
into the store so that the state of the form will be persisted in the
store. At the end of this exercise you will be able to:

-   Use react-redux-form to interact with Redux store and store the
    state of the form in the store.

### Updating the Feedback Form

-   Add a new file named <i>forms.js</i> in the <i>redux</i> folder and add the
    following to it:

```
> export const InitialFeedback = {
>     firstname: \'\',
>     lastname: \'\',
>     telnum: \'\',
>     email: \'\',
>     agree: false,
>     contactType: \'Tel.\',
>     message: \'\'
> };
```

-   Then, open <i>configureStore.js</i> and update it to add the form to the
    reducers:

```
> . . .
> import { createForms } from \'react-redux-form\';
> . . .
> import { InitialFeedback } from \'./forms\';
> . . .
>         combineReducers({
>             dishes: Dishes,
>             comments: Comments,
>             promotions: Promotions,
>             leaders: Leaders,
>             \...createForms({
>                 feedback: InitialFeedback
>             })
>         }),
> . . .
```

-   Next, open <i>MainComponent.js</i> and update it as follows:

```
> . . .
> import { actions } from \'react-redux-form\';
> . . .
>   resetFeedbackForm: () =\> { dispatch(actions.reset(\'feedback\'))}
> . . .
> \<Route exact path=\'/contactus\' component={() =\> \<Contact resetFeedbackForm={this.props.resetFeedbackForm} /\>} /\>
>
> . . .
```

-   Open CommentComponent.js and update it as follows:

```
> . . .
> import { Control, Form, Errors, actions } from \'react-redux-form\';
> . . .
>     handleSubmit(values) {
>         console.log(\'Current State is: \' + JSON.stringify(values));
>         alert(\'Current State is: \' + JSON.stringify(values));
>         this.props.resetFeedbackForm();
>         // event.preventDefault();
>     }
> . . .
>                         \<Form model=\"feedback\" onSubmit={(values) =\> this.handleSubmit(values)}\>
>                           . . .
>
>                         \</Form\>
> . . .
```

-   Save all the changes and do a Git commit with the message \"React
    Redux Forms Revisited\".

### Conclusions

In this exercise we have seen how to use react-redux-form together with
Redux to persist form state.

## Module: Client-Server Communication: Objectives and Outcomes

In this lesson you will learn about communication between your React
application and a server. You will establish a simple server using the
json-server node module. At the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

-   Set up a simple server that makes data available for clients

-   Access the data from the server using a browser.

-   Use the json-server as a simple static web server.

## Networking Essentials

## Brief Representational State Transfer (REST)

## Exercise (Video): Setting up a Server using json-server

## Exercise (Instructions): Setting up a Server using json-server

### Exercise Resources

<b>db</b>

JSON File

<b>images</b>

### Objectives and Outcomes

The Node module, <i>json-server</i>, provides a very simple way to set up a
web server that supports a full-fledged REST API server. It can also
serve up static web content from a folder. This lesson will leverage
these two features to provide the back-end for your React application.
In this exercise, you will configure and start a server using
<i>json-server</i> to enable serving your application data to your Angular
application. At the end of this exercise, you will be able to:

-   Configure and start a simple server using the json-server module

-   Configure your server to serve up static web content stored in a
    folder named <i>public</i>.

### Installing json-server

-   json-server is a node module, and hence can be installed globally by
    typing the following at the command prompt:

     npm install json-server -g

If you are using OSX or Linux, use <b>sudo</b> at the front of the command.
This will install json-server that can be started from the command line
from any folder on your computer.

### Configuring the Server

-   At any convenient location on your computer, create a new folder
    named <b>json-server</b>, and move to this folder.

-   Download the db.json file provided above to this folder.

-   Move to this folder in your terminal window, and type the following
    at the command prompt to start the server:

```
>      json-server \--watch db.json -p 3001 -d 2000
```

-   This should start up a server at port number 3001 on your machine.
    The data from this server can be accessed by typing the following
    addresses into your <b>browser address bar</b>:

```
> [http://localhost:3001/dishes]{.underline}
>
> [http://localhost:3001/promotions]{.underline}
>
> [http://localhost:3001/leaders]{.underline}
>
> [http://localhost:3001/feedback]{.underline}
```

-   Type these addresses into the browser address and see the JSON data
    being served up by the server. This data is obtained from the
    db.json file

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   The json-server also provides a static web server. Any resources
    that you put in a folder named <b>public</b> in the <b>json-server</b>
    folder above, will be served by the server at the following address:

```
>   <http://localhost:3001/>
```

-   Shut down the server by typing <b>ctrl-C</b> in the terminal window.

### Serving up the Images

-   Create a public folder in your json-server folder.

-   Download the images.zip file that we provide above, unzip it and
    move the images folder containing the images to the public folder.

-   Restart the json-server as we did before. Now your server will serve
    up the images for our React app. You can view these images by typing
    the following into your browser address bar:

```
> [http://localhost:3001/images/]{.underline}\<image name\>.png
```

### Conclusions

In this exercise, you learnt how to configure and start a simple server
using the <b>json-server</b> node module. You also learnt how the server
can serve up static web content.

## Fetch

## Exercise (Video): Fetch from Server

## Exercise (Instructions): Fetch from Server

### Objectives and Outcomes

In this exercise you will incorporate Fetch into your React app and then
use it to communicate with the REST API server. At the end of this
exercise you will be able to:

-   Incorporate Fetch into your React app

-   Use Fetch to communicate with the REST API server

### Fetch

-   As a first step, let us install Fetch into our project as follows:

> yarn add cross-fetch@2.1.0

-   Now that we have installed Fetch, let us configure your application
    to connect to the server. First, create a file named <i>baseUrl.js</i> in
    the <i>shared</i> folder and add the following to it:

```
> export const baseUrl = \'[http://localhost:3001/]{.underline}\';
```

-   Make sure that the json-server is running and servi

-   ng up the data as illustrated in the previous exercise

-   Next, open <i>ActionTypes.js</i> and add the following:

```
. . .
export const ADD_COMMENTS = \'ADD_COMMENTS\';
export const COMMENTS_FAILED = \'COMMENTS_FAILED\';
export const PROMOS_LOADING = \'PROMOS_LOADING\';
export const ADD_PROMOS = \'ADD_PROMOS\';
export const PROMOS_FAILED = \'PROMOS_FAILED\';
```

-   Then, open <i>ActionCreators.js</i> and update it as follows:

```
> . . .
> import { baseUrl } from \'../shared/baseUrl\';
> . . .
>     return fetch(baseUrl + \'dishes\')
>     .then(response =\> response.json())
>     .then(dishes =\> dispatch(addDishes(dishes)));
> . . .
> export const fetchComments = () =\> (dispatch) =\> {    
>     return fetch(baseUrl + \'comments\')
>     .then(response =\> response.json())
>     .then(comments =\> dispatch(addComments(comments)));
> };
> export const commentsFailed = (errmess) =\> ({
>     type: ActionTypes.COMMENTS_FAILED,
>     payload: errmess
> });
> export const addComments = (comments) =\> ({
>     type: ActionTypes.ADD_COMMENTS,
>     payload: comments
> });
> export const fetchPromos = () =\> (dispatch) =\> {
>     dispatch(promosLoading());
>     return fetch(baseUrl + \'promotions\')
>     .then(response =\> response.json())
>     .then(promos =\> dispatch(addPromos(promos)));
> }
> export const promosLoading = () =\> ({
>     type: ActionTypes.PROMOS_LOADING
```

-   Next, open <i>comments.js</i> and update it as follows:

```
> import \</i> as ActionTypes from \'./ActionTypes\';
>
> export const Comments = (state = { errMess: null, comments:\[\]}, action) =\> {
>   switch (action.type) {
>     case ActionTypes.ADD_COMMENTS:
>       return {\...state, errMess: null, comments: action.payload};
>     case ActionTypes.COMMENTS_FAILED:
>       return {\...state, errMess: action.payload};
>     case ActionTypes.ADD_COMMENT:
>         var comment = action.payload;
>         comment.id = state.comments.length;
>         comment.date = new Date().toISOString();
>         return { \...state, comments: state.comments.concat(comment)};
>     default:
>       return state;
>   }
> };
```

-   Similarly, open <i>promotions.js</i> and update it as follows:

```
> import \</i> as ActionTypes from \'./ActionTypes\';
> export const Promotions = (state  = { isLoading: true,
>                                         errMess: null,
>                                         promotions:\[\]}, action) =\> {
>     switch (action.type) {
>         case ActionTypes.ADD_PROMOS:
>         return {\...state, isLoading: false, errMess: null, promotions: action.payload};
>         case ActionTypes.PROMOS_LOADING:
>             return {\...state, isLoading: true, errMess: null, promotions: \[\]}
>         case ActionTypes.PROMOS_FAILED:
>             return {\...state, isLoading: false, errMess: action.payload};
>         default:
>           return state;
>       }
> };
```

-   Now that the Redux actions are all updated, it\'s time to update the
    components.

-   Open <i>MainComponent.js</i> and update it as follows:

```
> . . . 
> import { addComment, fetchDishes, fetchComments, fetchPromos } from \'../redux/ActionCreators\';
> . . .
> const mapDispatchToProps = dispatch =\> ({
>   addComment: (dishId, rating, author, comment) =\> dispatch(addComment(dishId, rating, author, comment)),
>   fetchDishes: () =\> { dispatch(fetchDishes())},
>   resetFeedbackForm: () =\> { dispatch(actions.reset(\'feedback\'))},
>   fetchComments: () =\> dispatch(fetchComments()),
>   fetchPromos: () =\> dispatch(fetchPromos())
> });
>
> . . .
>   componentDidMount() {
>     this.props.fetchDishes();
>     this.props.fetchComments();
>     this.props.fetchPromos();
>   }
> . . .
>           \<Home 
>               dish={this.props.dishes.dishes.filter((dish) =\> dish.featured)\[0\]}
>               dishesLoading={this.props.dishes.isLoading}
>               dishErrMess={this.props.dishes.errMess}
>               promotion={this.props.promotions.promotions.filter((promo) =\> promo.featured)\[0\]}
>               promoLoading={this.props.promotions.isLoading}
>               promoErrMess={this.props.promotions.errMess}
>               leader={this.props.leaders.filter((leader) =\> leader.featured)\[0\]}
>           /\>
> . . .
>\<DishDetail dish={this.props.dishes.dishes.filter((dish) =\> dish.id === parseInt(match.params.dishId,10))\[0\]}
>             isLoading={this.props.dishes.isLoading}
>             errMess={this.props.dishes.errMess}
```

-   Then, open <i>MenuComponent.js</i> and update it as follows:

```
> . . .
> import { baseUrl } from \'../shared/baseUrl\';
> . . .
>                     \<CardImg width=\"100%\" src={baseUrl + dish.image} alt={dish.name} /\>
> . . .
```

-   Then, open <i>HomeComponent.js</i> and update it as follows:

```
> . . .
> import { baseUrl } from \'../shared/baseUrl\';
> . . .
>
>        \<CardImg src={baseUrl + item.image} alt={item.name} /\>
> . . .
>         \<RenderCard item={props.promotion} isLoading={props.promoLoading} errMess={props.promoErrMess} /\>
>
> . . .
```

-   Then, open <i>DishdetailComponent.js</i> and update it as follows:

```
> . . .
>
> import { baseUrl } from \'../shared/baseUrl\';
> . . .
>                 \<CardImg top src={baseUrl + dish.image} alt={dish.name} /\>
> . . .
```

-   Save all the changes and do a Git commit with the message \"Fetch
    from Server\".

>                   \<Route path=\'/menu/:dishId\' component={DishWithId} /\>
                  \<Route exact path=\'/contactus\' component={() =\> \<Contact resetFeedbackForm={this.props.resetFeedbackForm} /\>} /\>
>                   \<Redirect to=\"/home\" /\>
>               \</Switch\>
>             \</CSSTransition\>
>           \</TransitionGroup\>
>
> . . .
```

-   Save all the changes and do a Git commit with the message \"React
    Animations\".

At the end of this assignment, you should have completed the following:

-   Introduced new action types and action creators to support the
    > fetching of the leaders information from the server and update the
    > Redux store.

-   Updated the Home and the About component to render the information
    > about the leaders using the downloaded data from the server

-   Add simple animations to the About component where the leaders
    > information is displayed.

-   Enabled the users to submit feedback through the feedback form by
    > creating a new feedback service that accepts the form data and
    > uses Restangular to record their feedback on the server.

<b>Assignment Requirements</b>

<b>Task 1</b>

In this task, you will update the Redux actions and the Home and About
components to use the data from the server for rendering the leader
information:

-   Add new action types in <i>ActionTypes.js</i> to support the fetching of
    > the leaders information from the server

-   Add new action creators in <i>ActionCreators.js</i> to enable the
    > fetching of the leaders information from the server and update the
    > Redux store

-   Update the code in <i>leaders.js</i> to respond to the dispatched Redux
    > actions and update the Redux store and appropriately handle the
    > loading and errors.

-   Update the code in <i>MainComponent.js</i> to fetch and use the leaders
    > information.

-   Update <i>HomeComponent.js</i> to render the leader information.

-   Update <i>AboutComponent.js</i> to render the leaders information. You
    > should handle the loading and error condition appropriately.

<b>Task 2</b>

In this task, you will enable the saving of the feedback data submitted
using the feedback form in the Contact component. You will save the
feedback form data submitted by the user to the server:

-   Implement a new action creator named postFeedback() that takes a
    > Feedback object as a parameter and submits the feedback to the
    > server using Fetch. Recall that the feedback data is accessible at
    > <http://localhost:3001/feedback> on the json-server.

-   Update <i>MainComponent.j</i>s to make the new dispatch method
    > postFeedback() available to ContactComponent.

-   Update the <i>ContactComponent.js</i> to submit the form data using the
    > postFeedback() method by passing the feedback form data.

<b>Task 3</b>

In this task you will use simple animation using
react-animation-components to enable a staggered rendering of the list
of leaders in AboutComponent:

-   Use the expand animation that we have already used earlier to
    > judiciously apply animation to the various stages of the form
    > submission.

## Module xx: Building and Deployment: Objectives and Outcomes

In this lesson you will learn about Webpack and how react-scripts uses
webpack to package your React application to create a distribution
folder. At the end of this exercise you will be able to:

-   Understand the Webpack way of packaging applications into bundles

-   Use react-scripts to build a distribution folder with your React
    application bundled using Webpack

## Introduction to Webpack

## Exercise (Video): Building and Deploying the React Application

## Exercise (Instructions): Building and Deploying the React Application

### Objectives and Outcomes

In this exercise you will learn to use the react-scripts to build a
distribution folder with the set of application files that can be copied
to a server to deploy your React application. At the end of this
exercise you will be able to:

-   Build your React application using the react-scripts to create a
    distribution folder

-   Deploy your application to a server by copying the built files to
    your server

### Building the Distribution Folder

-   To build the distribution folder containing your React application,
    type the following at the prompt:

npm run build

-   This should build a distribution folder named <i>build</i> containing all
    your application files.

### Deploying your React Application

-   To deploy your React application you need a server. Fortunately we
    already have the json-server available on our computer.

-   Copy the contents of the build folder to the public folder of your
    json-server

-   Now your React application can be accessed at the link
    <http://localhost:3001/>.

-   If you are setting up a server on the cloud or anywhere, all that
    you need to do is copy the contents of the build folder to the
    server side to deploy your React application. The exact procedure
    depends on the cloud service provider that you choose to use. Please
    consult their documentation to see the procedure to set up the
    server.

### Conclusions

In this exercise you learnt to use the react-scripts to build and deploy
your React application.

## Project Implementation: Objectives and Outcomes

This is the final stretch before you complete your project. By this time
you should already have a good scaffolding for your website. As you
flesh out your project and race towards completion, it is time to pause
and take stock of the current situation. Perhaps a critical look back at
the past, with the view of learning from our experience and
consolidating this learning into an effective, organized and repeatable
process is in order. Upon completion of the project it is important not
only to demonstrate the working project, but also summarize the process
of reaching the final goal. At the end of this lesson, you will be able
to:

-   Document the process of starting from an idea and reaching the
    conclusion of the project, not just the implementation, but also
    recognizing the process of reaching the end.

-   Learn lessons from the process in understanding what worked and what
    did not, and being able to make intelligent choices in the future
    based on the experience

-   Understand the design and development process through the practice.
